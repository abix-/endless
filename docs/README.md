# Endless Architecture Docs

## How to Use These Docs

These docs are the **source of truth** for system architecture. When building new features or modifying existing systems:

1. **Before coding**: Read the relevant doc to understand the current architecture, data flow, and known issues.
   For hot-path changes (per-frame/per-tick code), also apply [performance.md](performance.md).
   Hot-path default: Bevy `Query` for filtered scans, `EntityMap` for keyed lookups/indexes.
2. **During coding**: Follow the patterns documented here (job-as-template spawn, chained combat, GPU buffer layout). If you need to deviate, update the doc first.
3. **After coding**: Update the doc if the architecture changed. Add new known issues discovered during implementation.
4. **Code comments** stay educational (explain what code does for someone learning Rust/WGSL). Architecture diagrams, data flow, buffer layouts, and system interaction docs live here, not in code.
5. **README.md** is the game intro (description, gameplay, controls). **docs/roadmap.md** has stages (priority order) and capabilities (feature inventory) — read its maintenance guide before editing.
6. **Write docs in present tense**: explain what the system currently does. Put historical change logs ("was/used to/fixed") in **completed.md** or **CHANGELOG.md**, not architecture docs.

## Test Framework

UI-selectable integration tests run inside the full Bevy app via a bevy_egui menu. From `AppState::MainMenu`, click "Debug Tests" to enter `AppState::TestMenu` which shows the test list; clicking a test transitions to `AppState::Running` where game systems execute normally. "Back to Menu" returns to MainMenu. Tests use **phased assertions** — each phase checks one pipeline layer and fails fast with diagnostic values.

**Architecture** (`rust/src/tests/`):
- `TestState` resource: shared phase tracking, counters, flags, results
- `TestRegistry`: registered test entries (name, description, phase_count, time_scale)
- `TestSetupParams`: SystemParam bundle for test setup (slot alloc, spawn, world data, town_access, factions, game time, test state, commands, gpu_updates, dirty_writers) — `add_town` auto-inits pathfind costs, `add_building`/`add_waypoint` fire `BuildingGridDirtyMsg` via dirty_writers (same pipeline as main game)
- `test_is("name")` run condition gates per-test setup/tick systems
- Each test exports `setup` (OnEnter Running) + `tick` (FixedUpdate after Behavior)
- Helpers: `tick_elapsed()`, `require_entity()` reduce boilerplate
- Cleanup on OnExit(Running): shared `game_cleanup_system` (same as OnExit Playing) — despawn all entities, reset all resources
- Run All: sequential execution via `RunAllState` queue (auto-advances after 1.5s, instant in CLI mode)
- Single tests stay running after pass/fail — user clicks Back in HUD to return
- CLI mode: `--test all` or `--test <name>` runs tests headless-style and exits with pass/fail summary (exit code 0/1)

**HUD**: Phase checklist overlay during test execution — gray `○` pending, yellow `▶` active, green `✓` passed, red `✗` failed. Back/Cancel button at bottom.

**Tests** (`src/tests/`):

| Test | Phases | What it validates |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| `vertical-slice` | 8 | Full core loop: spawn → work → raid → combat → death → respawn |
| `spawning` | 4 | Spawn entities, kill via health=0, slot freed, slot reused |
| `energy` | 3 | Energy starts at 100, drains over time, reaches ENERGY_HUNGRY |
| `movement` | 3 | Path-driven waypoint advancement, GPU positions update, AtDestination on arrival |
| `archer-patrol` | 5 | Patrol(guard) → Patrol(walk) → Patrol(guard) → rest when tired → resume |
| `farmer-cycle` | 5 | Work(transit) → Work(at_dest) → tired → rest → recover → return |
| `raider-cycle` | 5 | Dispatch group → arrive at farm → steal → return → deliver |
| `combat` | 6 | GPU targeting → Fighting → damage → health drop → death → slot freed |
| `projectiles` | 4 | Ranged targeting → projectile spawn → hit + damage → slot freed |
| `healing` | 3 | Damaged NPC near town → Healing marker → health recovers to max |
| `economy` | 5 | Farm growing → ready → harvest → raider forage → tent spawner respawn |
| `world-gen` | 6 | Grid dimensions, town placement, buildings, terrain, raider towns |
| `sleep-visual` | 3 | Resting NPC gets sleep icon (atlas_id=3.0) on status layer, cleared on wake |
| `farm-visual` | 3 | Ready farm spawns FarmReadyMarker, cleared on harvest |
| `heal-visual` | 3 | Healing NPC gets halo (atlas_id=2.0) on healing layer, cleared when healed |
| `npc-visuals` | 1 | Visual showcase: all NPC types in labeled grid with individual layer breakdown |
| `terrain-visual` | 1 | Visual showcase: all terrain biomes and building types in labeled grid |
| `friendly-fire-buildings` | 4 | Ranged shooter fires through friendly farm wall without damaging same-faction buildings |
| `endless-mode` | 14 | Builder + raider fountain destroyed → spawn queued → boat migration → settle (both AI kinds) |
| `ai-building` | 2 | AI town building observation: pick personality, watch it build with 100K food+gold on a 10000x10000 map |
| `miner-cycle` | 5 | Miner: walk to mine → tend → harvest gold → deliver → rest |
| `archer-tent-reliability` | 5 | Archer vs enemy tent: target lock, projectile activity, sustained tent damage, destruction |
| `slot-reuse-wave` | 5 | AI wave vs destroyed building: Entity identity prevents ABA slot reuse (wave correctly ends) |
| `coalesce-movement` | 2 | GPU-authoritative position safety: SetPosition on foreign slot doesn't teleport other NPCs |
| `coalesce-arrival` | 2 | GPU-authoritative arrival safety: arrived NPC stays stable after unrelated SetTarget |
| `pathfind-maze` | 5 | NPCs navigate serpentine wall maze via A* pathfinding (configurable count 1-5000, slider UI) |
| `sandbox` | 1 | Human player sandbox: 1 player + 1 AI town, 100K food+gold, no raiders — auto-completes for free play |
