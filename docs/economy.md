# Economy System

## Overview

Economy systems handle time progression, food production, starvation, raider foraging, and AI decisions. All run in `Step::Behavior` and use `GameTime.hour_ticked` for hourly event gating. Defined in `rust/src/systems/economy.rs` and `rust/src/systems/ai_player.rs`.

## Data Flow

```
game_time_system (every frame)
    │
    ▼ sets hour_ticked = true when hour changes
    │
    ├─ farm_growth_system (every frame, uses game-time delta)
    │   └─ BuildingInstance: Growing → Ready when progress >= 1.0
    │
    ├─ raider_forage_system (hourly)
    │   └─ Each raider town gains RAIDER_FORAGE_RATE food
    │
    ├─ spawner_respawn_system (hourly)
    │   └─ Detects dead NPCs linked to FarmerHome/ArcherHome/FighterHome/Tent/MinerHome, counts down 12h timer, spawns replacement
    │
    ├─ starvation_system (hourly)
    │   └─ NPCs with zero energy → Starving marker
    │
    ├─ mine_regen_system (every frame, uses game-time delta)
    │   └─ MineStates: gold slowly regenerates when mine is unoccupied
    │
    ├─ sync_miner_progress_render (every frame)
    │   └─ Populates MinerProgressRender from miners with MiningProgress (positions + progress for GPU bar rendering)
    │
    ├─ farm_visual_system (every frame)
    │   └─ BuildingInstance Growing→Ready: spawn FarmReadyMarker; Ready→Growing: despawn
    │
    ├─ ai_decision_system (real-time interval, default 5s)
    │   └─ Per AI settlement: build → unlock slots → buy upgrades (food-gated, personality-driven)
    │   └─ Uses AiBuildRes SystemParam bundle (8 mutable resources) to stay under Bevy's 16-param limit
    │
    └─ squad_cleanup_system (message-gated: MessageReader<SquadsDirtyMsg>)
        └─ Phase 1: remove dead slots from Squad.members
        └─ Phase 2: keep Default Squad (0) as live pool of unsquadded player archers
        └─ Phase 3: dismiss excess if members > target_size (remove SquadId)
        └─ Phase 4: auto-recruit unsquadded player archers if members < target_size (insert SquadId)
```

## Systems

### game_time_system
- Advances `GameTime.total_seconds` based on `time.delta_secs() * time_scale`
- Sets `hour_ticked = true` when the hour changes (single source of truth for hourly events)
- Respects `paused` flag
- Other systems check `game_time.hour_ticked` instead of tracking their own timers

### growth_system (unified farms + mines)
- Runs every frame, advances growth based on elapsed game time
- Skips tombstoned entries (`position.x < -9000`) — destroyed farms/mines don't regrow
- **BuildingInstance fields**: `growth_ready: bool` (false = growing, true = ready to harvest) and `growth_progress: f32` (0.0-1.0) on each Farm/Mine instance in `EntityMap`
- **Hybrid growth model**:
  - Passive: `FARM_BASE_GROWTH_RATE` (0.08/hour) — ~12 game hours to full growth
  - Tended: `FARM_TENDED_GROWTH_RATE` (0.25/hour) — ~4 game hours with farmer working
- Farm transitions to `Ready` when progress >= 1.0
- Checks `inst.occupants >= 1` (slot-indexed on `BuildingInstance`) to determine if a farmer is tending
- **FarmYield upgrade**: growth rate multiplied by `1.0 + level * 0.15` per-town (reads `TownUpgrades` via `inst.town_idx`)

### raider_forage_system
- Runs when `game_time.hour_ticked` is true
- Each raider town (faction > 0) gains `RAIDER_FORAGE_RATE` (1) food per hour
- Passive income ensures raiders can survive even if they never steal

### spawner_respawn_system
- Runs when `game_time.hour_ticked` is true
- Iterates all `BuildingInstance` entries in `EntityMap` where `respawn_timer > -2.0` (spawner-capable buildings). Spawner fields (`npc_slot: i32`, `respawn_timer: f32`) live directly on `BuildingInstance` — no separate SpawnerState resource.
- Sentinel values: `npc_slot = -1` (no NPC alive), `respawn_timer = -2.0` (non-spawner building), `-1.0` (not respawning), `>= 0.0` (countdown active)
- If `npc_slot >= 0` and NPC is dead (not in `EntityMap`): starts 12h respawn timer
- Timer decrements 1.0 per game hour; on expiry: allocates slot via `SlotAllocator`, emits `SpawnNpcMsg`, logs to `CombatLog`
- All spawner buildings (world gen and player-built) start with `respawn_timer: 0.0` and `npc_slot: -1` — the system spawns the first NPC on the next hourly tick. No separate initial spawn function.
- Tombstoned entries (position.x < -9000) are skipped (building was destroyed)
- Spawn mapping resolved by `world::resolve_spawner_npc()` (single source of truth, takes `&BuildingInstance`): FarmerHome → Farmer (nearest farm via `find_nearest_free` as hint, no claim at spawn — farmer self-claims via behavior system), ArcherHome → Archer (nearest waypoint via `find_location_within_radius`), FighterHome → Fighter (nearest waypoint via `find_location_within_radius`), Tent → Raider (home = tent position), MinerHome → Miner (assigned mine from `BuildingInstance.assigned_mine` if set, otherwise nearest gold mine via `find_nearest_free`). All types look up faction from `world_data.towns[town_idx].faction`. Note: spawner_respawn_system does **not** pre-claim work slots — farmers self-claim via `find_farmer_farm_target()` in decision_system.

### starvation_system
- Query-first: `(&EntitySlot, &Energy, &CachedStats, &mut NpcFlags, &mut Health)` with `Without<Building>, Without<Dead>` — no `EntityMap` dependency
- Runs when `game_time.hour_ticked` is true
- NPCs with `energy <= 0` get `starving` flag set on `NpcFlags`
- Starving NPCs: speed set to `CachedStats.speed * STARVING_SPEED_MULT` (0.5) via `GpuUpdate::SetSpeed`
- **HP cap**: always clamps HP to `max_health * STARVING_HP_CAP` (50%) for all starving NPCs (handles both transition and save/load edge cases) via `GpuUpdate::SetHealth`
- When energy rises above 0 (eating or resting): `starving` is cleared, speed restored to `CachedStats.speed`

## Farm Growth

Farms have a growth cycle instead of infinite food:

```
     farm_growth_system advances progress
              │
              ▼
┌──────────┐      progress >= 1.0      ┌─────────┐
│ Growing  │ ────────────────────────▶ │  Ready  │ (shows food icon)
│progress++│                           │progress=1│
└──────────┘                           └────┬────┘
      ▲                                     │
      │            farmer/raider arrival    │
      └─────────────────────────────────────┘
              reset to Growing, progress=0

```

**Farm harvest** uses `BuildingInstance::harvest()` (single source of truth for Ready → Growing transition):
- `harvest(&mut self, combat_log, game_time, faction) -> i32` — resets `growth_ready` to false, `growth_progress` to 0.0, returns yield (farm=1 food, mine=MINE_EXTRACT_PER_CYCLE gold), logs to CombatLog. Returns 0 if not ready.
- All farm harvest callers use `EntityMap::find_farm_at[_mut](pos)` for O(1) position-based lookup via spatial grid.
- All callers enter `Activity::Returning { loot }` and carry yield home — delivery happens via `arrival_system` proximity check. No caller instant-credits storage.
- Called from 5 sites: arrival_system (working farmer harvest), decision_system (farmer GoingToWork arrival), decision_system (raider steal), decision_system (miner Mining arrival), decision_system (MiningAtMine harvest)

**Farmer harvest** (visible food transport):
- Working farmer at farm: `arrival_system` detects Ready farm, calls `harvest()`, releases occupancy, clears `NpcWorkState.occupied_slot`, enters `Returning { loot: [(Food, 1)] }` targeting home. Farmer visibly carries food sprite home.
- GoingToWork arrival: claims farm if not already owned, then checks Ready — if Ready, `harvest()` + release claim + `Returning`. If not Ready, `Working` (tending).
- On delivery at home: farmer goes `Idle` — decision system re-evaluates best target (may pick a different farm if one is Ready). Dynamic work→carry→deliver→re-evaluate cycle.

**Raider steal** (decision_system, Raiding arrival):
- Uses `find_location_within_radius()` to find farm within FARM_ARRIVAL_RADIUS
- Only steals if farm is Ready — `harvest()` resets farm, enters `Returning { loot: Food }`
- If farm not ready: find a different farm (excludes current position, skips tombstoned); if no other farm found, return home
- Logs "Stole food → Returning" vs "Farm not ready, seeking another" vs "No other farms, returning"

**Farm destruction**: Building removal from `EntityMap` handles cleanup. Tombstoned position (x < -9000) causes render pipeline to skip the crop sprite and `growth_system` to skip growth.

**Visual feedback**: `farm_visual_system` watches `EntityMap` Farm instances for state transitions and spawns/despawns `FarmReadyMarker` entities (keyed by `farm_slot: usize` — building slot). Uses `Local<HashMap<usize, bool>>` to detect transitions without extra resources. `!ready → ready` spawns a marker; `ready → !ready` (harvest) despawns it.

## Starvation

Energy is the single survival resource. When energy hits zero, the NPC is starving:

```
energy_system drains energy while active
        │
        ▼  starvation_system (hourly)
energy <= 0?
        │
    YES ▼
┌────────────┐
│  Starving  │  - HP capped at 50%
│   marker   │  - Speed reduced to 50%
└────┬───────┘
     │ energy > 0 (eating or resting)
     ▼
Starving marker cleared
Speed restored to CachedStats.speed
```

**Recovery paths:**
- **Eat**: consumes 1 food from town storage, instantly restores energy to 100. No travel required.
- **Rest**: walk home to spawner building (FarmerHome/ArcherHome), recover energy slowly (6 hours 0→100). Works even when starving.

**Constants:**
- `STARVING_HP_CAP`: 0.5 (50% of MaxHealth)
- `STARVING_SPEED_MULT`: 0.5 (50% of normal speed)

Starvation applies to **both villagers and raiders**. If raiders can't steal food and their town runs out, they'll starve and become easier to kill.

The HP cap is enforced by `starvation_system` (immediate clamp on every hourly tick) and `healing_system` (healing zone caps at 50% for starving NPCs). No other system can raise HP outside healing zones.

## Raider Attack System

Raiders use the AI squad commander's wave-based attack cycle (see [ai-player.md](ai-player.md#wave-based-attack-cycle)). Each raider town gets one squad containing all raiders. The `ai_squad_commander_system` picks the nearest enemy farm as target, gathers raiders until `wave_min_start` (RAID_GROUP_SIZE) are ready, then dispatches the wave. Wave ends when the target is destroyed or losses exceed `wave_retreat_below_pct` (30%).

Raiders without a squad assignment wander near their town. Group attacks use squad-driven waves.

**Constants:**
- `RAID_GROUP_SIZE`: 3 (minimum raiders to start a wave)

### Building Costs

Flat costs via `building_cost(kind)` in `constants.rs` (no difficulty scaling). All defined in `BUILDING_REGISTRY`:

| Building | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Farm | 2 |
| FarmerHome | 2 |
| MinerHome | 4 |
| ArcherHome | 4 |
| CrossbowHome | 8 |
| FighterHome | 5 |
| Waypoint | 1 |
| Tent | 3 |

Both player build menu and AI player use `building_cost()` for affordability checks.
| SPAWNER_RESPAWN_HOURS | 12.0 | Game hours before dead NPC respawns from building |
| MINE_MAX_GOLD | 200.0 | Maximum gold a mine can hold |
| MINE_REGEN_RATE | 2.0/hour | Gold regeneration rate (when unoccupied) |
| MINE_EXTRACT_PER_CYCLE | 5 | Base gold per mining cycle (scaled by GoldYield upgrade: `base * (1 + level * 0.15)`) |
| MINE_WORK_HOURS | 4.0 | Game hours per mining work cycle (progress bar 0→1) |
| MINE_MIN_SETTLEMENT_DIST | 300.0px | Minimum distance from mine to any town center |
| MINE_MIN_SPACING | 400.0px | Minimum distance between mines |

### mine_regen_system
- Runs every frame, advances mine gold based on elapsed game time
- Only regenerates when mine has no occupant (`inst.occupants == 0` via slot-indexed `BuildingInstance`)
- Rate: `MINE_REGEN_RATE` (2.0 gold/hour), capped at `MINE_MAX_GOLD` (200.0) per mine
- Uses `MineStates` resource — parallel Vecs of gold, max_gold, and positions per mine

### mining_policy_system
- Gated by `MessageReader<MiningDirtyMsg>` — only runs when mining topology/policy changes (radius slider, mine toggle, miner spawn/death)
- **Discovery**: scans `EntityMap.iter_kind(GoldMine)` within `PolicySet.mining_radius` of each faction-0 town center, populates `MiningPolicy.discovered_mines[town_idx]`
- **Distribution**: collects alive auto-assigned miners per town (skips `manual_mine == true` on `BuildingInstance`), round-robin assigns across enabled discovered mines via `BuildingInstance.assigned_mine`
- **Stale clearing**: if assigned mine falls outside radius or disabled, clears `assigned_mine` on auto-assigned miners
- **mine_enabled**: keyed by GPU slot (`HashMap<usize, bool>`) instead of sequential index, decoupled from WorldData ordering
- `MAX_MINE_OCCUPANCY` in `constants.rs` limits concurrent miners per mine; behavior system (`decision_system`) skips full mines

### squad_cleanup_system
- Message-gated via `MessageReader<SquadsDirtyMsg>` — skips entirely when no squad-relevant changes occurred
- Signal emitted by: `death_system` (any death), `spawn_npc_system` (archer spawn), left_panel UI (assign/dismiss), save load (`emit_all()`)
- **Phase 1**: retains only members whose slot is still in `EntityMap` (alive)
- **Phase 2**: keeps Default Squad (index 0) as live pool of unsquadded player military NPCs (query-first via `(&EntitySlot, &Job, &TownId, Option<&SquadId>)` with `Without<Building>, Without<Dead>`, inserts `SquadId(0)`)
- **Phase 3**: if `target_size > 0` and `members.len() > target_size`, dismisses excess (removes `SquadId` + `DirectControl` components, pops from members)
- **Phase 4**: if `target_size > 0` and `members.len() < target_size`, auto-recruits unsquadded player-faction military NPCs from the same query (inserts `SquadId`, pushes to members). Pool is shared across squads — earlier squad indices get priority.

## Dynamic Raider Town Migration

New raider towns spawn organically as the player grows. Three systems in `economy.rs` handle the lifecycle:

```
migration_spawn_system (hourly check)
        │
        ▼ check_timer >= RAIDER_SPAWN_CHECK_HOURS (12h)?
        │ player_alive >= VILLAGERS_PER_RAIDER * (raider_count + 1)? (alive towns only)
        │ no active migration? alive raider_towns < MAX_RAIDER_TOWNS (20)?
        │
        ▼ YES: spawn group at nearest map edge to settle target
        │
        ├─ Create Town entry (faction = max+1, sprite_type = 1)
        ├─ Create TownGrid, extend all per-town resources (food, gold, factions, raider_state, policies)
        ├─ Create inactive AiPlayer (active: false, kind: Raider, random personality)
        ├─ Spawn N raiders via SpawnNpcMsg with Home = player town center
        │   Group size: MIGRATION_BASE_SIZE (3) + player_alive / difficulty.migration_scaling()
        │   (Easy=6, Normal=4, Hard=2), capped at 20
        ├─ pick_settle_site() selects target position (farthest from existing towns)
        ├─ Spawn boat entity at map edge (building slot with ATLAS_BOAT sprite)
        └─ Store MigrationGroup in MigrationState resource
           Combat log: "A raider band approaches from the {direction}!"

migration_attach_system (after Step::Spawn, before Step::Combat)
        │
        ▼ if migration active: attach Migrating component to spawned entities
           (bridges 1-frame gap between SpawnNpcMsg and entity creation)

migration_settle_system (every frame, early-returns if no active migration)
        │
        ▼ BOAT phase: sail boat toward settle_target at BOAT_SPEED
        │ when boat reaches land → disembark NPCs (SpawnNpcMsg), free boat slot
        │
        ▼ ATTACH phase: insert Migrating component on spawned entities
        │ (bridges 1-frame gap between SpawnNpcMsg and entity creation)
        │
        ▼ SETTLE phase: read GPU positions for group members
        │ compute average position
        │
        ▼ within RAIDER_SETTLE_RADIUS (500px) of settle_target?
        │
        ▼ count == 0 (all dead)? → queue replacement, clear migration
        │
        ▼ YES: settle town
        ├─ Town center = settle_target (verified land cell, not NPC centroid)
        ├─ spawner fields set on BuildingInstance for each tent
        ├─ stamp_dirt() around town
        ├─ Activate AiPlayer (active = true)
        ├─ Remove Migrating from members, update Home to settle_target
        ├─ Force tilemap rebuild (TilemapSpawned = false)
        └─ Clear MigrationState.active
           Combat log: "A raider band has settled nearby!"

        ▼ WIPEOUT: count == 0 but member_slots not empty (all NPCs dead)
        ├─ Queue replacement PendingAiSpawn (same strength/resources, 4h delay)
        ├─ Combat log: "The migrating {kind} was wiped out!"
        └─ Clear MigrationState.active (unblock pipeline for next migration)
```

**Movement**: Migration group spawns a boat entity (building slot with `ATLAS_BOAT` sprite) at the map edge nearest to the settle target. The boat sails toward `settle_target` at `BOAT_SPEED` (150px/s). When the boat reaches land (non-water terrain), NPCs disembark — spawned at the boat position with `Migrating` component, boat slot freed. NPCs then walk toward `settle_target` using the existing `Home` component + `Action::Wander` behavior.

**Settlement site selection**: `pick_settle_site()` samples 100 random land positions and picks the one farthest from all existing towns — ensures new settlements spread across the map rather than clustering. The verified `settle_target` position is used for all placement (town center, buildings, dirt stamp, NPC homes, combat log) — never the NPC centroid `avg_pos` (which could be over water).

**Migration wipeout**: If all NPCs in the group die before settling (`count == 0` but `member_slots` not empty), the migration is cleared and a replacement `PendingAiSpawn` is queued with `ENDLESS_RESPAWN_DELAY_HOURS` (4h) delay. The replacement inherits the original group's `upgrade_levels`, `starting_food`, and `starting_gold`. This ensures the target number of AI towns is eventually reached — it's endless.

**Save/load**: `MigrationState` serialized as `Option<MigrationSave>` in `SaveData`. On load, `Migrating` component re-attached to saved member slot entities.

**AiPlayer.active**: New `bool` field. `ai_decision_system` skips inactive players. All existing AiPlayer creation sites set `active: true`. Migration creates with `active: false`, activated on settlement.
