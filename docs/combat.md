# Combat System

## Overview

Ten Bevy systems handle the complete combat loop: cooldown management, GPU-targeted attacks (with building fallback), damage application, death detection, XP-on-kill grant, cleanup with slot recycling, waypoint slot sync, building tower auto-attack (fountains), and building damage processing. Nine run chained in `Step::Combat`; `building_damage_system` runs in `Step::Behavior`.

attack_system fires projectiles via `PROJ_GPU_UPDATE_QUEUE` when in range, or applies point-blank damage for melee. The projectile system ([projectiles.md](projectiles.md)) handles movement, collision detection, hit readback, and slot recycling.

## Components

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Health | `f32` | Current HP (default 100.0) |
| Dead | marker | Inserted when health <= 0 |
| LastHitBy | `i32` | NPC slot index of last attacker (-1 = no attacker). Inserted by damage_system, read by xp_grant_system. |
| Faction | `struct(i32)` | Faction ID (-1=Neutral, 0=Player, 1+=AI settlements). NPCs attack different factions. Neutral (-1) is treated as same-faction by GPU combat targeting and projectile collision. |
| BaseAttackType | enum | `Melee` or `Ranged` — keys into `CombatConfig.attacks` HashMap. Crossbow units use `Ranged` but stats resolve from `CombatConfig.crossbow_attack` (overridden by Job in `resolve_combat_stats`). |
| CachedStats | struct | `damage, range, cooldown, projectile_speed, projectile_lifetime, max_health, speed` — resolved from `CombatConfig` via `resolve_combat_stats()` |
| AttackTimer | `f32` | Seconds until next attack allowed |
| CombatState | enum | `None`, `Fighting { origin: Vec2 }`, `Fleeing` — orthogonal to Activity enum (see [behavior.md](behavior.md)) |
| ManualTarget | enum | Player target: `Npc(usize)` (attack NPC slot), `Building(Vec2)` (attack building), `Position(Vec2)` (ground move). Inserted by right-click on DirectControl NPCs. `Npc` variant overrides GPU auto-targeting; others fall through. |

## System Pipeline

Execution order is **chained** — each system completes before the next starts.

### 1. cooldown_system (combat.rs)
- Decrements `AttackTimer` by `time.delta_secs()` each frame
- When timer reaches 0, attack is available
- Updates `CombatDebug` with sample timer and entity count

### 2. attack_system (combat.rs)
- **Manual target override**: if NPC has `ManualTarget::Npc(slot)`, uses that slot as target instead of GPU `combat_targets[i]`. Auto-clears `ManualTarget` when target's GPU health <= 0 (dead). `ManualTarget::Building` and `ManualTarget::Position` variants fall through to GPU auto-targeting. See [behavior.md](behavior.md#squads) for how `ManualTarget` is set.
- **Hold fire**: if NPC's squad has `hold_fire == true` and no `ManualTarget`, target is set to -1 (skip auto-engage). Reads `SquadState` via `SquadId`.
- Falls back to `GpuReadState.combat_targets` for NPCs without manual target or hold-fire.
- **Skips** NPCs with `Activity::Returning`, `Activity::GoingToRest`, or `Activity::Resting` (prevents combat while heading home, going to bed, or sleeping)
- **Validates GPU target** before engaging — rejects self-targets (`ti == i`), non-NPC slots (`NpcEntityMap` lookup — buildings are not in `NpcEntityMap` so building targets naturally rejected), same-faction or neutral targets (`GpuReadState.factions`), and dead targets (`GpuReadState.health <= 0`). Invalid targets clear `CombatState` and skip.
- If target is valid (not -1), passes validation, and in bounds:
  - Sets `CombatState::Fighting { origin }` (stores current position)
  - **In range**: sets `SetTarget` to own position (stand ground — stops GPU movement, NPC holds position while shooting). Projectile dodge from GPU shader provides evasion.
  - **In range + cooldown ready**: resets `AttackTimer`, fires projectile or applies point-blank damage
  - **Out of range**: pushes `GpuUpdate::SetTarget` to chase
- If no NPC target: sets `CombatState::None`, then checks for opportunistic building attack:
  - Only **archers**, **crossbows**, and **raiders** attempt building attacks (farmers/miners/fighters skip)
  - Queries `BuildingSpatialGrid` via `find_nearest_enemy_building()` for enemy buildings within `CachedStats.range`
  - Non-targetable buildings skipped: Fountain, GoldMine, Bed
  - **Raiders**: only target ArcherHome, CrossbowHome, Waypoint, Wall (breach defenses; leave FarmerHome/MinerHome alone for farm raiding)
  - **Archers/Crossbows**: target any enemy building type (except non-targetable)
  - "Enemy" = building faction != NPC faction (uses `BuildingRef.faction` field)
  - If found and cooldown ready: stand ground (SetTarget to own pos), fire projectile toward building position, reset cooldown
  - Building damage is applied directly: `attack_system` emits `BuildingDamageMsg` immediately on cooldown-ready building attack. Projectile spawned with `damage: 0.0` (visual only — buildings are not in the NPC GPU buffer so no GPU collision possible).
  - NPCs don't chase buildings — pure attack of opportunity when nearby with nothing better to do

### 3. damage_system (health.rs)
- Drains `DamageMsg` events from Bevy MessageReader
- O(1) entity lookup via `NpcEntityMap[npc_index]`
- Subtracts damage: `health.0 = (health.0 - amount).max(0.0)`
- Pushes `GpuUpdate::SetHealth` to sync GPU health buffer
- Pushes `GpuUpdate::SetDamageFlash` (intensity 1.0) for visual hit feedback
- If `DamageMsg.attacker >= 0`: inserts `LastHitBy(attacker)` on target entity (overwrites previous)

### 4. death_system (health.rs)
- Queries all NPCs with Health but `Without<Dead>`
- If `health.0 <= 0.0`: insert `Dead` marker component

### 5. xp_grant_system (stats.rs)
- Queries entities `With<Dead>` that have `Option<&LastHitBy>`
- If `LastHitBy` present, looks up killer entity via `NpcEntityMap`
- Grants 100 XP to killer's `NpcMetaCache` entry
- Increments `FactionStats.inc_kills()` for the killer's faction
- Checks for level-up: `level_from_xp(new_xp) > level_from_xp(old_xp)`
- On level-up: re-resolves `CachedStats`, updates `Speed` component, rescales HP proportionally (`hp * new_max / old_max`), sends `GpuUpdate::SetSpeed` and `GpuUpdate::SetHealth`, emits `CombatEventKind::LevelUp` to `CombatLog`
- **Loot on kill**: reads `npc_def(dead_job).loot_drop` (slice of LootDrop entries with item/min/max), picks one deterministically via `xp % len`, then deterministic spread via `min + (xp % range)`. Military NPCs (archers, crossbows, fighters, raiders) drop food or gold; farmers drop food; miners drop gold. Sets killer to `Activity::Returning { loot }`, clears `CombatState::None` (immediate disengage — loot delivery is highest priority), targets home. Accumulates into existing Returning loot if already carrying. **DC keep-fighting**: if killer has `DirectControl` and `SquadState.dc_no_return` is true, loot is accumulated but combat is NOT disengaged and GPU target is NOT set to home — NPC keeps fighting with loot piling up.
- XP formula: `level = floor(sqrt(xp / 100))`, level multiplier = `1.0 + level * 0.01`

### 6. death_cleanup_system (health.rs)
- Queries all entities `With<Dead>`
- For each dead entity:
  1. `commands.entity(entity).despawn()` — remove from Bevy ECS
  2. `npc_map.0.remove(&idx)` — remove from O(1) lookup
  3. `GpuUpdate::HideNpc { idx }` — full slot cleanup on GPU:
     - Position → (-9999, -9999)
     - Target → (-9999, -9999) — prevents zombie movement
     - Arrival → 1 — stops GPU from computing movement
     - Health → 0 — ensures click detection skips slot
  4. Release `AssignedFarm` via `BuildingOccupancy.release()` if farmer had one
  5. Release `WorkPosition` via `BuildingOccupancy.release()` if miner was at a mine
  6. Update stats: `PopulationStats` (dec_alive, inc_dead, dec_working if `Working` or `MiningAtMine`), `FactionStats` (dec_alive, inc_dead), `KillStats`
  7. Remove from `NpcsByTownCache`
  8. Deselect if `SelectedNpc` matches dying NPC (clears inspector panel)
  9. `SlotAllocator.free(idx)` — recycle slot for future spawns
- **Building-specific cleanup** (detected via `Building` component):
  1. Remove from `BuildingEntityMap` via `get_building(idx)` → `remove_by_building(kind, data_idx)`
  2. `GpuUpdate::BldHide + BldSetHealth(0)` → BuildingGpuState
  3. `BuildingSlots.free(idx)` — recycle building slot
  4. Skip all NPC-specific logic (population stats, faction stats, etc.)

### 7. sync_waypoint_slots (combat.rs)

- Gated by `DirtyFlags.waypoint_slots` — skips entirely when no waypoints built/destroyed/loaded
- Scans `BuildingEntityMap.iter_kind(Waypoint)` for slot mismatches:
  - **Alive post, no slot** (`position.x > -9000 && npc_slot == None`): allocates `SlotAllocator` index, emits GPU updates (SetPosition, SetTarget, SetSpeed=0, SetHealth=999, SetSpriteFrame col=-1). Sprite col=-1 makes the slot invisible to NPC renderer. SetTarget=position causes GPU to immediately mark settled.
  - **Tombstoned post, has slot** (`position.x < -9000 && npc_slot == Some`): emits `HideNpc`, frees slot
- Faction set in a second pass (borrow split: `iter_mut` on waypoints prevents reading towns simultaneously)
- Clears `dirty.waypoint_slots` after sync

### 8. building_tower_system (combat.rs)

Generalized tower system for any building kind that auto-shoots. Uses a shared `fire_towers()` helper parameterized by `BuildingKind`, `TowerStats`, and a `(Vec2, i32)` slice of (position, faction).

- **TowerState** resource: holds per-kind `TowerKindState` with `timers: Vec<f32>` and `attack_enabled: Vec<bool>`
- **TowerStats** struct in `constants.rs`: `range`, `damage`, `cooldown`, `proj_speed`, `proj_lifetime`
- State length auto-syncs with building count each tick
- **Fountains**: `FOUNTAIN_TOWER` (range=400, damage=15, cooldown=1.5s, proj_speed=350, proj_lifetime=1.5s). Always-on — `attack_enabled` refreshed from `is_alive(town.center)` every tick (all alive town centers shoot). Strong enough to defend spawn area.
- **CPU-side targeting**: Buildings are no longer in the NPC GPU buffer. `fire_towers()` scans NPC positions/factions/health arrays from `GpuReadState` directly (CPU brute-force over `npc_count` slots). For each enabled tower, finds nearest enemy NPC within range (different faction, health > 0, position not hidden). Buildings are few (~10-50 towers), so O(towers × npcs) is acceptable.
- `fire_towers()` loop: for each enabled building, CPU finds nearest enemy NPC, validates range, fires `ProjGpuUpdate::Spawn` with `shooter: -1`
- DRY: adding a new tower building kind requires a `TowerStats` const, a `TowerKindState` field in `TowerState`, and a block in `building_tower_system`. `Building::is_tower()` and the shader handle the rest.

### 9. building_damage_system (combat.rs, Step::Behavior)
- Uses `BuildingDeathExtra` SystemParam bundle (NpcMetaCache, SquadState, AiPlayerState, EndlessMode, TownUpgrades, FoodStorage, GoldStorage) to stay within Bevy's 16-parameter limit
- Reads `BuildingDamageMsg` events via `MessageReader`
- Decrements entity `Health` component on the building entity (looked up via `BuildingEntityMap.get_entity_by_building(kind, idx)` → entity)
- Looks up position/town via `BuildingEntityMap::get_instance(slot)` (position + town_idx from `BuildingInstance`)
- Sets `DirtyFlags.buildings_need_healing` when a building survives damage (hp > 0)
- Syncs HP to GPU: writes `GpuUpdate::BldSetHealth` with new HP (routed to `BuildingGpuState`)
- Skips already-dead buildings (HP <= 0) and indestructible buildings (GoldMine, Road)
- When HP reaches 0:
  1. Captures linked NPC slot from `SpawnerState` by position match **before** destroy (tombstoning changes position)
  2. Calls `destroy_building()` shared helper (grid clear + spawner tombstone + combat log + mark building entity Dead)
  3. Inserts `Dead` on building entity (reuses death_cleanup_system pipeline)
  4. Kills linked NPC via `GpuUpdate::HideNpc` + `SetHealth(0.0)`
  5. **Building loot**: `BuildingDef::loot_drop()` method returns `cost / 2` as food (None if cost 0). Attacker set to `Activity::Returning { loot }`, targets home. Accumulates into existing loot. DC keep-fighting override same as xp_grant_system (skip disengage + skip home target when `dc_no_return`).
- Profiled under `"building_damage"` scope

## Slot Recycling

```
NPC Spawn:  SlotAllocator.alloc()  ──▶ pop free list (or next++)
                                              ▲
NPC Death:  death_cleanup_system  ────────────┘
            SlotAllocator.free(idx)

Building:   BuildingSlots.alloc()  ──▶ pop free list (or next++)
                                              ▲
Bld Death:  death_cleanup_system  ────────────┘
            BuildingSlots.free(idx)
```

NPCs and buildings use separate slot allocators (`SlotAllocator` max=100K, `BuildingSlots` max=5K) backed by a shared `SlotPool` inner type. This eliminates slot collisions that previously occurred when buildings and NPCs shared the same pool.

Slots are raw `usize` indices without generational counters. This is safe because:
1. Combat systems are **chained** — damage is applied and death is processed in the same frame
2. Slot reuse only happens on the **next** spawn call, which writes fresh GPU data before the next dispatch
3. No cross-frame references exist to stale indices

## GPU Integration

| Direction | What | How |
|-----------|------|-----|
| GPU → CPU | Combat targets | `GpuReadState.combat_targets[]` — populated via Bevy `ReadbackComplete` observer |
| GPU → CPU | Positions | `GpuReadState.positions[]` — populated via Bevy `ReadbackComplete` observer |
| GPU → CPU | Projectile hits | `ProjHitState` — populated via Bevy `ReadbackComplete` observer, includes expired sentinel (-2) |
| CPU → GPU | Health sync | `GpuUpdate::SetHealth` after damage |
| CPU → GPU | Hide dead | `GpuUpdate::HideNpc` resets position, target, arrival, health |
| CPU → GPU | Stand ground | `GpuUpdate::SetTarget` to own position when in attack range (stops movement, allows proj dodge) |
| CPU → GPU | Chase target | `GpuUpdate::SetTarget` when out of attack range |
| CPU → GPU | Fire projectile | `ProjGpuUpdate::Spawn` via `PROJ_GPU_UPDATE_QUEUE` (attack_system + building_tower_system + building attack fallback) |
| CPU → GPU | Guard post slots | `sync_waypoint_slots` allocates NPC slots for waypoints, sets position/faction/speed=0/health=999/sprite=-1 |
| CPU → GPU | Building HP sync | `building_damage_system` writes entity `Health` + `GpuUpdate::BldSetHealth` to sync building HP in `BuildingGpuState` |
| CPU | Building targeting | `fire_towers()` scans NPC `GpuReadState.positions/factions/health` CPU-side (buildings no longer in NPC GPU buffer) |
| CPU | Building damage | `attack_system` emits `BuildingDamageMsg` directly on building attack; projectile is visual-only (`damage: 0.0`) |

## Debug

`CombatDebug` (Bevy Resource) updated each frame by cooldown_system and attack_system:
- attackers_queried, targets_found, attacks_made, chases_started, in_combat_added
- positions_len, combat_targets_len, bounds_failures
- sample_target_idx, sample_dist, sample_timer
- in_range_count, timer_ready_count

`HealthDebug` (Bevy Resource) updated by damage/death/healing systems:
- damage_processed, deaths_this_frame, despawned_this_frame, bevy_entity_count
- healing_npcs_checked, healing_in_zone_count, healing_healed_count

## Known Issues / Limitations

- **No generational indices**: Stale references to recycled slots would silently alias. Currently safe due to chained execution, but would break if damage messages span frames.
- **No friendly fire**: Faction check prevents same-faction damage. No way to enable it selectively.
- **CombatState::Fighting blocks behavior decisions**: While fighting, decision_system skips the NPC. However, Activity is preserved through combat — when combat ends (`CombatState::None`), the NPC resumes its previous activity.
- **KillStats naming inverted**: `guard_kills` tracks raiders killed (by guards), `villager_kills` tracks villagers killed (by raiders). The names describe the victim, not the killer.
