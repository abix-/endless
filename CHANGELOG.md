# Changelog

## 2026-02-16

- **guard post slot plumbing (phase update)** — added `npc_slot: Option<usize>` initialization at remaining GuardPost construction sites so world-gen, runtime placement, save-load reconstruction, and patrol tests all compile against the new GuardPost shape (`rust/src/world.rs`, `rust/src/save.rs`, `rust/src/tests/archer_patrol.rs`, `rust/src/tests/vertical_slice.rs`)
- **guard post slot queue scaffold** — added `GuardPostSlotQueue` resource plus `GpSlotRequest::{Allocate, Free}` in `rust/src/resources.rs` to support deferred guard-post slot allocation/free processing in a dedicated system
- **roadmap detail expansion (performance backlog)** — expanded Stage 15 guard-post optimization item with explicit WIP status and remaining file-level tasks; added two actionable DirtyFlags follow-ups (lifecycle hardening + regression tests) with implementation steps, acceptance criteria, and validation plan
## 2026-02-15g

- **autosave system** â€” `autosave_system` triggers every N game-hours (default 12, configurable 0-48 on main menu); writes to 3 rotating files (`autosave_1.json`, `autosave_2.json`, `autosave_3.json`); `SaveLoadRequest` tracks interval/slot/last-hour; `UserSettings.autosave_hours` persisted; main menu "Autosave" slider between Difficulty and Play button; 0 = disabled

## 2026-02-15f

- **dirty flag consolidation** â€” replaced 4 separate dirty-flag types (`BuildingGridDirty`, `PatrolsDirty`, `SpatialDirtyFlags` SystemParam, `HealingZoneCache.dirty`) with single `DirtyFlags` resource (`building_grid`, `patrols`, `healing_zones`, `patrol_swap`); all default `true` so first frame always rebuilds; `rebuild_building_grid_system` now gated on `DirtyFlags.building_grid` (skips 99%+ of frames); `pending_swap` payload moved from deleted `PatrolsDirty` into `DirtyFlags.patrol_swap`; touches 11 files, pure refactor â€” no behavioral changes

## 2026-02-15e

- **GPU threat assessment** â€” move NPC threat counting (enemy/ally within 200px) from CPU O(N) linear scan to GPU spatial grid query; piggybacks on existing Mode 2 combat targeting neighbor loop in `npc_compute.wgsl`; packs `(enemies << 16 | allies)` into a single u32 per NPC, readback via `GpuReadState.threat_counts`; `decision_system` unpacks for flee threshold calculation; eliminates `count_nearby_factions()` CPU function; adds `threat_radius` param to `NpcComputeParams`; binding 16 on compute shader
- **save/load: load from main menu** â€” "Load Game" button on main menu (grayed if no save); `game_load_system` runs before `game_startup_system` via `.chain()`; skips world gen if save was loaded; centers camera on first town after load
- **vertical-slice test hardened** â€” adds WorldGrid init, BuildingHpState entries, spawner buildings (FarmerHome/ArcherHome/Tent), SpawnerEntry registration for all NPCs; extends timeout 60â†’90s for respawn phase; adds `building_hp` to test cleanup
- **patrol route fix** â€” `build_patrol_route` now filters out destroyed guard posts (position.x > -9000)

## 2026-02-15d

- **save/load system (Stage 18 MVP)** â€” F5 quicksave / F9 quickload with JSON serialization to `Documents/Endless/saves/quicksave.json`; saves full game state: WorldGrid terrain+buildings, WorldData (towns/farms/beds/guard posts/homes), GameTime, FoodStorage, GoldStorage, FarmStates, MineStates, SpawnerState, BuildingHpState, TownUpgrades, TownPolicies, AutoUpgrade, SquadState, GuardPostState, CampState, FactionStats, KillStats, AiPlayerState, and all live NPC data (position, health, energy, activity, combat state, personality, equipment, squad); load despawns all entities, rebuilds resources from save, spawns NPCs with saved state, triggers tilemap + spatial grid + patrol route rebuild; toast notification with fade-out on save/load; save version field + `#[serde(default)]` for forward compatibility; SystemParam bundles keep systems under Bevy's 16-parameter limit

## 2026-02-15c

- **difficulty system + building cost rebalance** â€” `Difficulty` enum (Easy/Normal/Hard) selectable on main menu, persisted in settings; `building_cost(kind, difficulty)` replaces 6 hardcoded `*_BUILD_COST = 1` constants with differentiated base costs (Normal: Farm=3, FarmerHome=5, MinerHome=5, ArcherHome=8, GuardPost=10, Tent=3); Easyâ‰ˆhalf, Hard=double; player build menu, click-to-place, and AI player all use `building_cost()`
- **roadmap update** â€” marked food consumption, starvation effects, and building cost rebalance as complete in Stage 14

## 2026-02-15b

- **building damage now projectile-based** â€” `attack_system` no longer sends direct `BuildingDamageMsg` on fire; instead `process_proj_hits` checks active projectile positions against `BuildingSpatialGrid` (20px hit radius) and sends `BuildingDamageMsg` on collision; buildings now take damage from actual projectile hits, not instantly when fired
- **building HP bars render properly** â€” fragment shader now renders 3-color health bars (green/yellow/red) in bottom 15% of building quads for atlas_idâ‰¥4.5; previously discarded all pixels for bar-only mode
- **main menu reorganization** â€” moved AI Think, NPC Think, and Raider Passive Forage sliders from main area to Advanced collapsible section; cleaner default menu
- **FPS counter style** â€” changed from gray semi-transparent to black bold for readability
- **default towns 2â†’1** â€” new games start with 1 player town instead of 2
- **roadmap cleanup** â€” 1443â†’277 lines; moved 267 completed items to `docs/completed.md`; extracted 4 specs to `docs/specs/`; deleted done specs (AI Players, Continent WorldGen); collapsed done stages; renamed Godot parityâ†’Backlog: UI & UX; moved game design tables to `docs/concepts.md`; fixed Guardâ†’Archer terminology throughout docs

## 2026-02-15

- **building HP bars** â€” damaged buildings now display GPU-instanced health bars using atlas_id=5.0 bar-only mode (shader discards sprite, keeps bar); `BuildingHpRender` resource extracted to render world; all building types now have HP (Town=500, GoldMine=200, Bed=50); `Building::kind()` returns `BuildingKind` (no longer `Option`) â€” Fountain/Camp map to `Town`, Bed added as new variant
- **trait display from Personality** â€” inspector reads traits from `Personality` component via `trait_summary()` instead of cached `trait_id` in `NpcMetaCache`; `TraitKind::name()` method added
- **NPC rename in inspector** â€” text field + Rename button (or Enter) edits `NpcMetaCache.name` directly; `InspectorRenameState` local tracks active rename slot
- **BuildingSpatialGrid includes Beds** â€” beds now in spatial grid; `find_nearest_enemy_building()` skips Bed + Town + GoldMine (non-targetable)
- **SquadParams loses meta_cache** â€” `squads_content` takes `&NpcMetaCache` from roster params instead of bundling its own copy
- **RespawnTimers removed** â€” stale legacy resource deleted; `SpawnerState` is sole authority for respawn timing
- **fix: rebuild_patrol_routes performance** â€” replaced `WorldData.is_changed()` trigger (fired every frame when Patrols tab open due to `ResMut` DerefMut leak) with explicit `PatrolsDirty` resource set only on guard post build/destroy/reorder; added per-town route cache (O(towns) instead of O(archers)); merged `RosterRenameState` into `RosterState` to stay under Bevy's 16-param limit after adding `PatrolsDirty` to `left_panel_system`; `left_panel_system` now takes `Res<WorldData>` instead of `ResMut`
- **building HP & NPC building attacks** â€” all buildings now have HP (GuardPost=200, ArcherHome=150, FarmerHome/MinerHome/Tent=100, Farm=80); archers and raiders opportunistically fire at enemy buildings when no NPC target is in range; raiders only target military buildings (ArcherHome, GuardPost); buildings destroyed at HPâ‰¤0 with linked NPC killed; `BuildingHpState` resource with parallel Vecs; `BuildingDamageMsg` direct-on-fire message; `BuildingSpatialGrid` extended with all building types + faction field; `building_damage_system` processes damage and calls shared `destroy_building()` helper
- **DRY: destroy_building() consolidation** â€” extracted shared `destroy_building()` in world.rs that handles grid clear + WorldData tombstone + spawner tombstone + HP zero + combat log; replaces duplicated destroy paths in click-destroy and inspector-destroy; also used by building_damage_system for HPâ†’0 destruction
- **AiBuildRes SystemParam bundle** â€” `ai_decision_system` hit Bevy's 16-param limit when adding BuildingHpState; bundled 8 mutable world resources into `AiBuildRes<'w>` SystemParam struct (same pattern as CleanupWorld); reduces param count from 17â†’11
- **fix: squad rest-when-tired** â€” squad archers now properly go home to rest when energy is low; three interacting bugs fixed: (1) arrival handler catches tired archers before entering OnDuty (prevents Patrollingâ†”OnDuty oscillation), (2) hard gate with hysteresis before combat priorities forces GoingToRest (enter at energy < 30, stay until â‰¥ 90), (3) squad sync block only writes GPU targets when needed instead of every frame (OnDuty archers only redirected when squad target moves >100px); `attack_system` now skips GoingToRest NPCs to prevent GPU target override
- **upgrade tree restructure (14â†’16)** â€” renamed Archer-specific upgrades to Military (applies to Archer + Raider + Fighter); added per-job upgrades: FarmerMoveSpeed, MinerHp, MinerMoveSpeed, GoldYield; removed ArcherSize and FoodEfficiency; categories: Military (7), Farmer (3), Miner (3), Town (3); `UPGRADE_RENDER_ORDER` defines tree UI layout with indentation depth; `upgrade_effect_summary()` shows current/next effect in UI; `branch_total()` per-category totals; `expansion_cost()` custom slot-based pricing for TownArea; Dodge now requires MoveSpeed Lv5 (was AlertRadius Lv1)
- **gold yield upgrade** â€” miners extract more gold per cycle with GoldYield upgrade (+15% per level); `decision_system` mining extraction reads `TownUpgrades`
- **upgrade UI tree rendering** â€” left panel Upgrades tab now renders upgrades in tree order with branch headers, indentation, branch totals, and effect summaries (now â†’ next); auto-upgrade checkbox persists immediately to settings
- **settings version migration** â€” settings v1â†’v2 no longer resets all settings; outdated versions get new fields filled with defaults; added `auto_upgrades` persistence for per-upgrade auto-buy flags
- **AI upgrade weights updated** â€” `ai_player.rs` upgrade weights expanded to 16 entries matching new upgrade tree; raiders now score Military HP/Attack/AttackSpeed; builders score Miner and Farmer upgrades by personality
- **town build grid symmetry fix** â€” base build bounds changed from `-2..+3` to `-3..+3` (7x7) so towns/camps now have exactly 3 build slots outward in each direction from the center fountain/camp; updated related `TownGrid` docs/comments
- **selection indicator unification (world-space)** â€” added corner-bracket selection overlay for clicked NPCs and clicked buildings (no build-menu highlight); NPC uses smaller bracket size, building uses larger `WorldGrid`-scaled bracket; removed old NPC circle selection stroke for consistent visual language
- **build toggle polish** â€” removed up/down arrow text from build button and adjusted bottom offset so the closed button sits flush with the UI edge
- **tech tree prereqs + multi-resource costs (stage 19 chunk 1)** â€” `UPGRADE_REGISTRY` in `stats.rs` extended with `prereqs: &[UpgradePrereq]` and `cost: &[(ResourceKind, i32)]` per node; `ResourceKind { Food, Gold }` enum (extensible for Stage 23 wood/stone/iron); tree structure: Archer branch (ArcherHealthâ†’ArcherAttackâ†’AttackSpeedâ†’ArcherRangeâ†’AlertRadius, ArcherHealthâ†’MoveSpeed), Economy branch (FarmYieldâ†’FarmerHp, FarmYieldâ†’FoodEfficiency), Town branch (HealingRateâ†’FountainRadius, FountainRadius+FoodEfficiencyâ†’TownArea); shared helpers `upgrade_unlocked()`, `upgrade_available()`, `deduct_upgrade_cost()`, `missing_prereqs()`, `format_upgrade_cost()` used by all 4 systems (process_upgrades, auto_upgrade, AI, UI); `TownUpgrades::town_levels()` DRY accessor; gold-cost nodes show "10g", mixed-cost show "10+10g"; locked nodes dimmed with prereq tooltip; auto-upgrade + AI skip locked nodes
- **upgrade metadata registry (DRY)** â€” `UpgradeNode` struct centralizes label/short/tooltip/category (previously duplicated in `left_panel.rs` UPGRADES array + UPGRADE_SHORT array + `ai_player.rs` match block); all consumers read from single `UPGRADE_REGISTRY` const array in `stats.rs`
- **rename: Guardâ†’Archer, Houseâ†’FarmerHome, Barracksâ†’ArcherHome, MineShaftâ†’MinerHome** â€” full codebase rename of NPC types and building names to reflect 1:1 buildingâ†’NPC relationships; `Job::Guard` â†’ `Job::Archer`, `Guard` marker â†’ `Archer`; `Building::House/Barracks/MineShaft` â†’ `Building::FarmerHome/ArcherHome/MinerHome`; `WorldData.houses/barracks/mine_shafts` â†’ `farmer_homes/archer_homes/miner_homes`; `BuildKind` variants renamed; `PolicySet` fields renamed with `#[serde(alias)]` for backwards compat; `UpgradeType::Guard*` â†’ `UpgradeType::Archer*`; `UserSettings.guards` â†’ `archers` with serde alias; all UI labels, combat log messages, test names updated; `guard_patrol.rs` â†’ `archer_patrol.rs`; `GuardPost` intentionally kept (it's the building, not the NPC)
- **mine shaft spawner building** â€” new `Building::MineShaft` spawns miners directly (1:1 buildingâ†’NPC like Houseâ†’Farmer, Barracksâ†’Guard); replaces the confusing `job_reassign_system` that converted farmersâ†”miners via `MinerTarget` DragValue; `resolve_spawner_npc()` building_kind=3 â†’ Miner (finds nearest gold mine); buildable from player build menu (cost=1 food); AI builds mine shafts by personality (Aggressive=1/3, Balanced=1/2, Economic=2/3 of houses); `try_build_inner()` DRY helper consolidates 5 identical AI build arms; deleted `MinerTarget` resource + `job_reassign_system` + miner DragValue UI
- **DRY: building + spawner + harvest consolidation** â€” `build_and_pay()` shared by player build menu + AI (eliminates duplicated place+pay+spawner logic); `register_spawner()` single construction site for all SpawnerEntry structs; `Building::spawner_kind()` derives spawner type from enum (no more magic 0/1/2 numbers); `resolve_spawner_npc()` shared by startup + respawn for building_kindâ†’SpawnNpcMsg mapping; `FarmStates::harvest()` single authority for Readyâ†’Growing transition used by farmer harvest (3 sites) and raider theft
- **build placement overhaul** â€” replaced right-click context menu with bottom-center horizontal build bar showing building sprites (cached atlas extraction) + concise help text; click-to-place with grid-snapped ghost preview (green=valid, red=invalid); destroy mode in build bar and inspector; `TownGrid.area_level` replaces `HashSet<(i32,i32)>` for expandable build area; `BuildKind::Destroy` + `DestroyRequest` resource for inspectorâ†’system destroy flow; slot indicators only visible during active placement
- **UI scale** â€” `ui_scale` setting (default 1.2, range 0.8-2.5) persisted in `UserSettings`; applied via `EguiContextSettings.scale_factor`; slider in pause menu Settings
- **in-game help tooltips** â€” `HelpCatalog` resource with ~35 help entries; `help_tip()` renders "?" buttons with rich hover tooltips; top bar has getting-started tip + tips on every stat (Food, Gold, Pop, Farmers, Guards, Raiders); every left panel tab (Roster, Upgrades, Policies, Patrols, Squads, Intel, Profiler) shows contextual help at top; build menu buttons have detailed hover text; NPC inspector shows tips on Level/XP, Trait, Energy, State; all help text answers "what is this?" AND "how do I use it?"
- **embedded assets** â€” release builds embed all assets (sprites + shaders) in the binary via `bevy_embedded_assets` v0.15; standalone 81MB exe runs without any external files; `ReplaceAndFallback` mode allows asset modding by placing files next to exe; assets restructured into standard Bevy layout (`rust/assets/sprites/`, `rust/assets/shaders/`); debug builds still load from disk for hot-reload

## 2026-02-14

- **squad auto-replenish** â€” squads now have a `target_size` field; set via DragValue in Squads tab instead of +1/+2/+4 recruit buttons; `squad_cleanup_system` auto-recruits unsquadded player guards when members drop below target (e.g. death) and dismisses excess when target is lowered; target_size=0 disables auto-recruit (manual mode); Dismiss All resets target_size to 0
- **profiler columns** â€” profiler panel now uses 3-column grid (system | ms | count); count entries (`decision/n_*`) paired to their timing row instead of mixed in as fake millisecond values; renamed `d.*` keys to `decision/*` for readability

## 2026-02-13

- **building spatial grid** â€” CPU-side spatial grid (`BuildingSpatialGrid`) for O(1) building lookups; 256px cells, rebuilt once per frame by `rebuild_building_grid_system` (before `decision_system`); replaces linear scans + Vec allocation in `find_location_within_radius`, `find_within_radius`, `find_nearest_free`, `find_nearest_location`; all use `distance_squared` instead of `sqrt`; `for_each_nearby` closure pattern avoids intermediate allocations; indexes farms, guard posts, towns, and gold mines; `d.arrival` should drop from ~2ms to ~0.1-0.3ms at 4700 NPCs
- **profiler copy button** â€” "Copy Top 10" button in system profiler panel copies frame time + top 10 system timings to clipboard
- **combat log keyboard toggle** â€” press L to show/hide combat log window; `combat_log_visible` field on `UiState`
- **decision throttling** â€” three-tier NPC decision system: arrivals every frame, combat flee/leash every 8 frames (~133ms), all other decisions (rest/work/idle scoring) bucketed by configurable interval (default 2s); `NpcDecisionConfig` resource + "NPC Think" slider in main menu (0.5-10s); with 5100 NPCs at 2s interval, only ~42 NPCs evaluate slow decisions per frame instead of 5100; `SystemTimings.record()` helper for sub-profiling; `d.arrival`/`d.combat`/`d.idle` sub-scope timings in profiler
- **miner job type** â€” proper `Job::Miner` (job_id=4, brown tint) replaces the `mining_pct` slider; houses still spawn farmers, `job_reassign_system` converts idle farmersâ†”miners to match per-town `MinerTarget`; `Miner` marker component, own Work branch in `decision_system` (find nearest mine with gold), shares farmer schedule/flee/off-duty policies; DragValue control in roster panel sets miner count; AI sets miner targets by personality (Aggressive=1/3, Balanced=1/2, Economic=2/3 of houses); miner base stats match farmer; miners show brown color in roster/left panel; conversion is bidirectional â€” reducing miner count converts them back to farmers with nearest free farm assignment
- **gold mines** â€” wilderness resource nodes placed between towns during world gen; miners walk out to mine gold; miners claim occupancy, extract `MINE_EXTRACT_PER_CYCLE` gold when tired, carry it home via `Activity::Returning { gold }` for proximity delivery to `GoldStorage`; mines regenerate `MINE_REGEN_RATE` gold/hour when unoccupied (capped at `MINE_MAX_GOLD`); mines are unowned â€” any faction's NPCs can use any mine; `Building::GoldMine` variant with `TileSpec::Single(43, 11)` sprite; HUD top bar shows gold count; mine inspector shows gold amount + progress bar + miner count; main menu slider for gold mines per town (0-10); `MineStates` + `GoldStorage` resources; `mine_regen_system` in Step::Behavior; `WorldGenConfig.gold_mines_per_town` persisted in settings
- **continents world generation** â€” new "Continents" mode selectable from main menu combo box; 3-octave fBm elevation noise with square-bump edge falloff (Red Blob Games approach) + independent moisture noise for biome selection (dryâ†’Rock, moderateâ†’Grass, wetâ†’Forest); towns/camps constrained to land cells; `WorldGenStyle` enum in `WorldGenConfig`, persisted in settings; Classic mode unchanged as default
- **floating inspector** â€” NPC/building inspector changed from full-width `TopBottomPanel::bottom` to floating `egui::Window` anchored bottom-left; only visible when something is selected; matches combat log pattern
- **combat log wider** â€” 350px â†’ 450px
- **system profiler** â€” `SystemTimings` resource with RAII `timings.scope("name")` guard pattern; internal Mutex so parallel systems don't serialize; toggle with F5; EMA-smoothed per-system millisecond timings
- **SystemParam bundles** â€” `CleanupResources` (health.rs, 9 resources) and `DecisionExtras` (behavior.rs, 6 resources) keep `death_cleanup_system` and `decision_system` under Bevy's 16-param limit
- **projectile dodge** â€” NPCs in combat stand their ground and shoot, but actively dodge incoming enemy projectiles; GPU spatial grid for projectiles (3-mode dispatch: clear, build, query) mirrors NPC grid pattern; NPC compute scans 3Ã—3 neighborhood for approaching arrows within 60px, strafes perpendicular to projectile velocity with urgency scaling; 1-frame latency (proj grid built by projectile compute, read by NPC compute next frame); fixes combat circling bug where `SetTarget` to enemy position every frame reset arrival flag, causing separation/dodge physics to orbit NPCs counter-clockwise
- **ai weighted random decisions** â€” AI building/upgrade decisions now use scored weighted random selection (same pattern as NPC behavior system) instead of strict priority ordering; personality weights bias probabilities (Aggressive favors barracks, Economic favors farms) but don't hard-lock; need factors scale scores based on building ratio deficits; fixes bug where Balanced/Economic AI never built barracks (farm+house conditions were mutually exhaustive)
- **external building sprites** â€” House, Barracks, and GuardPost buildings use dedicated 32x32 PNGs (`house.png`, `barracks.png`, `guard_post.png`) instead of world atlas tiles; new `TileSpec::External(usize)` variant; `build_tileset` accepts extra images slice for non-atlas tiles
- **faction-based NPC coloring** â€” player faction (0) uses job colors (green/blue/red/yellow), all other factions use faction palette; previously color was job-based (only raiders got faction colors)
- **fix: turret npc_count** â€” `guard_post_attack_system` uses `gpu_state.npc_count` instead of `positions.len() / 2` for enemy scanning bounds
- **2x2 composite tiles** â€” `TileSpec` enum (`Single`/`Quad`) enables tiles built from four 16x16 sprites; `build_tileset` produces 32x32 array texture layers with nearest-neighbor 2x upscale for single sprites and quadrant blitting for composites; Rock terrain, Farm, Camp, and Tent buildings now use 2x2 composites; new grass sprites (A=3,16 B=3,13)
- **carried food untinted** â€” food sprite on returning raiders renders with original texture colors instead of faction color tint; equipment layers (atlas 0) still use job color, carried items (atlas >= 0.5) use white
- **roster faction filter** â€” roster panel only shows player faction (faction 0) NPCs by default; existing "All NPCs in Roster" debug setting in pause menu toggles all-faction view; replaces old raiders-only hide filter
- **background fps setting** â€” pause menu checkbox "Full FPS in Background" keeps game running at full framerate when window is unfocused; persisted in settings; applied on startup via WinitSettings
- **terrain-visual test** â€” new debug test showcasing all terrain biomes and building types in a labeled grid; test cleanup now despawns tilemap chunks and resets TilemapSpawned

## 2026-02-12

- **ai personalities** â€” AI players get random personality (Aggressive/Balanced/Economic) at game start; personality drives build order, upgrade priority, food reserve threshold, and town policies; combat log shows personality tag (`Town [Balanced] built farm`); smart slot selection: economy buildings prefer inner slots, guard posts prefer outer slots with min spacing of 5; slot unlock now sets terrain to Dirt (visible on tilemap via new `sync_terrain_tilemap` system + `TerrainChunk` marker)
- **ai players** â€” autonomous AI opponents that build, unlock slots, and buy upgrades; Builder AI (farms/houses/barracks/guard posts), Raider AI (tents); unique faction per settlement; `ai_decision_system` in Step::Behavior; configurable interval (1-30s); purple "AI" combat log entries with filter
- **world gen refactor** â€” independent placement of player towns, AI towns, and raider camps (no longer paired 1:1); configurable counts (AI Towns 0-10, Raider Camps 0-10); unique faction per settlement; removed `find_camp_position()` helper
- **main menu overhaul** â€” "Towns" renamed to "Your Towns" for clarity; AI Towns / Raider Camps / AI Speed sliders; per-town sliders in collapsible section; Reset Defaults button; removed "Colony simulation" subtitle
- **fix: NPC count estimate** â€” estimate now correctly counts AI town NPCs and uses raider camp count (not player town count) for raiders
- **fix: turret friendly fire** â€” `guard_post_attack_system` looks up post's owning faction from town data instead of hardcoding faction 0; prevents turrets from shooting their own town's NPCs
- **fix: spawner faction** â€” `spawner_respawn_system` + `game_startup_system` use `world_data.towns[idx].faction` instead of hardcoded 0; enemy town farmers/guards now spawn with correct faction
- **delete combat_log.rs** â€” dead code removed (undeclared module, never registered, referenced nonexistent `UiState.combat_log_open`)
- **fix: healing fountain drift deadlock** â€” NPCs in `HealingAtFountain` state could be pushed out of healing range by separation physics and get stuck forever (HP never recovers, decision system `continue`s); added drift check that re-targets fountain when NPC drifts >100px from town center; added early arrival so `GoingToHeal` NPCs transition to `HealingAtFountain` as soon as they enter healing range (100px) instead of walking to exact center
- **fix: duplicate "Healing, Healing" state display** â€” NPC inspector was showing both `Activity::HealingAtFountain` name and `Healing` marker component; removed marker components (AtDestination, Starving, Healing) from state display â€” only shows Activity + CombatState enums
- **target overlay visibility** â€” thicker line (1.5â†’2.5px), brighter alpha (140â†’200), larger diamond (5â†’7px) and NPC circle (8â†’10px radius)
- **squads system** â€” player-directed guard groups; 10 squads with map target markers; reassign existing patrol guards via +1/+2/+4/+8/+16/+32 recruit buttons; squad guards walk to target instead of patrolling; all survival behavior preserved (flee, rest, heal, sleep); `SquadState` resource + `SquadId` component + `squad_cleanup_system`; new Squads tab in left panel (Q key), top bar button, colored numbered target overlay, click-to-place targeting with ESC/right-click cancel

## 2026-02-11

- **separate rest from heal** â€” NPCs go home (spawner) to rest (energy recovery) and to the fountain to heal (HP recovery); new `GoingToHeal` + `HealingAtFountain{recover_until}` Activity variants; `Resting` simplified to unit variant (energy-only); raiders now heal at camp center like villagers (removed raider exclusion); raider Home changed from camp center to tent position; sleep icon only shows for Resting, not HealingAtFountain; energy recovers during both states to prevent ping-pong
- **sleep sprite texture** â€” sleep indicator now uses dedicated `sleep.png` texture (4th atlas, bindings 6-7, atlas_id=3.0) instead of character sheet lookup; white tint preserves sprite's natural blue Zz; fragment shader dispatches sleep (â‰¥2.5) â†’ heal (â‰¥1.5) â†’ normal; sleep_visual test stride fix (`idx*2` â†’ `idx*3`) and assertion updated for atlas-based check
- **color saturation** â€” job colors changed from tinted to pure (farmer=green, guard=blue, raider=red, fighter=yellow); raider faction palette saturated (10 distinct pure colors instead of muted tints)
- **healing halo** â€” healing NPCs show a yellow halo ring sprite (`heal.png`) instead of a small icon overlay; third texture atlas bound at group 0 bindings 4-5 (`atlas_id=2.0`); healing layer renders at scale 20 with yellow tint; heal_visual test updated for new signal format (stride fix: `idx*2` â†’ `idx*3`)
- **color tuning** â€” guard blue tint slightly darker (0.4â†’0.3 green), raider base red more saturated (0.5â†’0.3)
- **npc-visuals test scene** â€” new test in Debug Tests that spawns all 4 NPC types (Guard/Farmer/Raider/Fighter) in a labeled 4Ã—7 grid showing each render layer individually (body, weapon, helmet, item, sleep, heal, full); egui labels at world positions with sprite coordinates; stays on screen for visual review
- **sprite coordinate updates** â€” Guard (0,0), Fighter (1,9), sword (45,6), helmet (28,0), sleep icon (24,7), food (24,9 on world atlas)
- **per-sprite atlas_id** â€” equipment/overlay buffers expanded from stride 2 (col, row) to stride 3 (col, row, atlas); body layer reads atlas from sprite_indices[2]; `SetSpriteFrame` gains `atlas` field; food carried item renders from world atlas; body layer skips rendering when sprite col < 0
- **per-job work schedules** â€” `work_schedule` split into `farmer_schedule` + `guard_schedule` in PolicySet; policies panel reorganized by job (Guards/Farmers sections)
- **auto-upgrade system** â€” per-upgrade auto-buy checkbox in Upgrades tab; `AutoUpgrade` resource + `auto_upgrade_system` queues affordable upgrades each game hour
- **remove FarmerCap/GuardCap upgrades** â€” UPGRADE_COUNT 14â†’12; population is building-driven (Stage 11), not upgrade-driven
- **merge policies+upgrades into left_panel** â€” deleted `policies_panel.rs` and `upgrade_menu.rs`; all UI lives in `left_panel.rs`
- **fix: raider wander drift** â€” `Action::Wander` now offsets from home position instead of current position, preventing unbounded random walk off the map; farm-seeking on raid arrival excludes current farm position and filters tombstoned farms, falls back to returning home if no other farm found; HP work gate lowered from 50% to 30% so starving raiders (HP capped at 50%) can still join raid queues
- **rename: Hut â†’ House** â€” `Building::Hut` â†’ `Building::House`, `WorldData.huts` â†’ `WorldData.houses`, `HUT_BUILD_COST` â†’ `HOUSE_BUILD_COST`, UI labels updated throughout
- **farms per town slider** â€” separate "Farms" slider in main menu (persisted in settings); farms placed first in spiral, then houses, then barracks
- **guard posts on corners** â€” guard posts placed at outer corners of all buildings (TL/TR/BR/BL) instead of spiral, ensuring perimeter coverage regardless of building count
- **fix: camera zoom over UI** â€” scroll wheel zoom disabled when pointer is over egui panels (combat log, etc.)
- **HUD: total population** â€” top bar shows `Pop: alive/total_spawners`
- **slider range increase** â€” barracks and tents sliders now go up to 5000
- **raider tent spawners** â€” raiders now spawn from individual Tent buildings instead of bulk camp spawns; `Building::Tent` variant + `WorldData.tents` + `BUILDING_TILES[7]`; `raider_respawn_system` removed, unified into `spawner_respawn_system` (building_kind 2=Tent â†’ Raider with camp center as home)
- **camp TownGrids** â€” raider camps get expandable building grids like villager towns; `TownGrid` gains `town_data_idx` field replacing fragile `grid_idx * 2` mapping; `find_town_slot()` iterates all grids using stored index; `place_camp_buildings()` places Camp center + N Tents via spiral
- **build menu: camp support** â€” right-clicking camp grid slots shows Tent build option; villager-only buildings (Farm/GuardPost/Hut/Barracks) gated to faction==0 grids
- **guard posts on perimeter** â€” guard posts now placed after all spawner buildings via `spiral_slots()` so they're always on the outer ring regardless of slider values
- **HUD: raider/tent counts** â€” top bar shows `Raiders: alive/tents` for first raider camp; building inspector supports Tent (shows linked NPC + respawn timer)
- **main menu: rename raiders â†’ tents** â€” slider now labeled "Tents" (1 raider per tent)

## 2026-02-10

- **fix: spiral building placement** â€” replace hardcoded 12-slot spawner array with `spiral_slots()` generator; `generate_world()` now populates `TownGrids` directly, auto-unlocking slots beyond base 6x6 grid; supports slider values up to 1000 huts/barracks per town
- **fix: settings path cross-platform** â€” fall back to `HOME` env var when `USERPROFILE` missing (macOS/Linux)
- **readme: per-platform getting started** â€” separate Windows/macOS/Linux install instructions with prerequisites
- **refactor: FarmOccupancy â†’ BuildingOccupancy** â€” generic `Worksite` trait + `find_nearest_free()`/`find_within_radius()`/`find_by_pos()` replace farm-specific helpers; private field with claim/release/is_occupied/count API prevents double-increment bugs
- **fix: town index convention** â€” remove `Ã·2` pair-index conversion; NPCs and buildings both use direct WorldData indices (villagers at even, raiders at odd); fixes build menu spawner town_idx, spawner_respawn, and `build_patrol_route` (now `pub(crate)`)
- **UI: building inspector** â€” click buildings to inspect; shows per-type details (farm growth/occupancy, spawner NPC status/respawn timer, guard post patrol order/turret, fountain heal radius/food, camp food); `SelectedBuilding` resource with grid col/row
- **UI: Patrols tab (T)** â€” left panel tab to view and reorder guard post patrol routes; swap buttons mutate `WorldData` which triggers `rebuild_patrol_routes_system`
- **rename: right_panel â†’ left_panel** â€” `RightPanelTab` â†’ `LeftPanelTab`, `right_panel_open` â†’ `left_panel_open`, module renamed
- **GPU: merged dodge/separation scan** â€” single 3x3 grid loop computes both separation and dodge forces; same-faction 1.5x push boost; avoidance clamped to `speed * 1.5`; lateral steering replaces backoff slowdown (routes around obstacles at 60% speed instead of jamming); backoff cap reduced from 200 to 30
- **HUD: per-town spawner counts** â€” top bar filters spawners by player's town_idx instead of showing global totals; format changed to `Farmers: alive/huts`, `Guards: alive/barracks`
- **rebuild_patrol_routes_system** â€” new system in `Step::Behavior` rebuilds all guards' patrol routes when `WorldData` changes (guard post added/removed/reordered)

## 2026-02-10

- **fix: enforce 1 farmer per farm** â€” `find_nearest_free_farm()` helper skips occupied farms; farm claiming gated on `FarmOccupancy` at arrival, spawn, and respawn; farmers redirect to free farm or idle when all occupied
- **remove role reassignment** â€” `reassign_npc_system`, `ReassignQueue` resource, and roster panel reassign buttons removed (building spawners replaced this workflow)
- **roadmap: stage 14 tower defense** â€” Wintermaul Wars-inspired TD mechanics: maze building with path validation, elemental rock-paper-scissors (6 elements), income/interest economy, competitive creep sending via guards, tiered tower upgrades, branching tower evolution
- **fix: guard post patrol order** â€” reorder post_slots so guards patrol clockwise (TL â†’ TR â†’ BR â†’ BL) instead of arbitrary order
- **fix: newly-built spawner timing** â€” change spawner timer check from `> 0.0` to `>= 0.0` so newly-built Huts/Barracks (timer=0.0) spawn their NPC on the next hourly tick
- **fix: settings loaded at app startup** â€” replace `init_resource::<UserSettings>()` with `insert_resource(load_settings())` so saved settings persist across app restarts

## 2026-02-10

- **remove beds** â€” NPCs rest at their spawner building (Hut/Barracks) instead of separate beds
  - remove beds from world gen (`place_town_buildings`), build menu, `BedOccupancy` resource, `LocationKind::Bed`
  - spawner_respawn_system sets home to building position instead of nearest bed
  - world-gen test updated: no longer counts beds in building phase
  - reduce hut/barracks build cost from 3/5 to 1/1
- **increase raider camp distance** from 1100px to 3500px (~3x farther, ~35s travel)
- **esc closes build menu** before toggling pause menu (standard innermost-UI-first pattern)
- **roadmap: continent world generation spec** added to stage 12

## 2026-02-11

- **stage 11: building spawners â€” population driven by Hut/Barracks buildings**
  - add `Hut`/`Barracks` building types with `Building` enum variants, tile sprites, place/remove/tombstone support
  - `SpawnerState` resource tracks buildingâ†’NPC links; each entry has building_kind, position, npc_slot, respawn_timer
  - `spawner_respawn_system` (hourly): detects dead NPCs via `NpcEntityMap`, counts down 12h timer, spawns replacement via `SlotAllocator` + `SpawnNpcMsg`
  - `game_startup_system` builds `SpawnerState` from world gen Huts/Barracks, spawns 1 NPC per building (replaces bulk farmer/guard loops)
  - `place_town_buildings` places N Huts + N Barracks from config sliders (sliders renamed to Huts/Barracks)
  - build menu: Hut (3 food) and Barracks (5 food) buttons with spawner entry on build, spawner tombstone on destroy
  - HUD top bar shows spawner counts (Huts: N, Barr: N, with respawning count)
  - cleanup resets `SpawnerState` on game exit

- **fix: ghost NPC rendering â€” replace NpcCount with SlotAllocator**
  - remove `NpcCount` resource (running total, never decremented on death â€” caused GPU to dispatch uninitialized slots)
  - remove `GpuDispatchCount` resource and `GPU_DISPATCH_COUNT` static (redundant with SlotAllocator)
  - GPU compute dispatch, flash decay, and projectile collision all use `SlotAllocator.count()` (high-water mark)
  - add `SlotAllocator.alive()` (`next - free.len()`) for UI display and test assertions
  - single source of truth for NPC counting eliminates the class of bug where multiple count resources diverge

- **fix: GPU readback for factions and health**
  - add factions + health readback buffers (COPY_SRC on GPU buffers, ReadbackComplete observers, render node copy)
  - enables `count_nearby_factions()` for flee threat assessment and guard post turret targeting
  - initialize combat_target readback buffer to -1 (prevents zeroed memory misread as "target NPC 0" causing instant kills on frame 1)
  - initialize factions readback buffer to -1 (prevents unspawned slots being treated as faction 0)

- **fix: guard patrol cross-town bug**
  - `build_patrol_route()` now converts NPC WorldData index (0, 2, 4...) to building pair index (0, 1, 2...) via `/ 2`
  - guards from town 1+ were patrolling wrong town's guard posts due to index convention mismatch

- **UI: left panel changed from SidePanel to floating Window**
  - roster/upgrades/policies panel now an anchored egui::Window with close button
  - changed Res<UiState> to ResMut<UiState> to support window close

## 2026-02-10

- **UI overhaul: top bar, bottom panel, policy persistence, FPS overlay**
  - replace left HUD panel with full-width top bar (panel toggles left, town name + time center, stats right) and bottom panel (inspector left, combat log with filter checkboxes right)
  - merge combat_log.rs into game_hud.rs bottom panel â€” remove standalone combat_log module
  - right panel renamed to left panel (SidePanel::left), simplified to heading + content (no inline tab bar)
  - move FPS counter from tests/mod.rs to ui/game_hud.rs, anchor bottom-right, register globally (visible on all screens)
  - persist town policies to settings.json (PolicySet + WorkSchedule + OffDutyBehavior now serde Serialize/Deserialize)
  - load saved policies on game startup, save on leaving Policies tab
  - settings file moved from executable directory to `Documents\Endless\settings.json`
  - add debug settings to pause menu (Enemy Info, NPC Coordinates, All NPCs in Roster)
  - add NPC Activity filter to combat log
  - roster hides raiders unless "All NPCs" debug setting enabled
  - remove `combat_log_open` from UiState (combat log now always visible in bottom panel)

- **behavior: tighten eat/rest thresholds, fix raider queue**
  - eat only scored when energy < ENERGY_EAT_THRESHOLD (10) â€” emergency only, NPCs prefer rest
  - rest only scored when energy < ENERGY_HUNGRY (50) â€” prevents unnecessary rest at high energy
  - fix raiders re-wandering every frame while already queued for raid â€” only wander on initial queue join
  - initialize GPU combat target buffer to -1 (prevents zeroed memory misread as "target NPC 0")

- **escape menu, tabbed right panel, maximized window**
  - ESC opens pause menu overlay (Resume, Settings, Exit to Main Menu) instead of instantly quitting â€” game stays in Playing state, auto-pauses when menu opens
  - pause menu settings: scroll speed slider + combat log filter checkboxes, saved to UserSettings on close
  - consolidated Roster, Upgrades, Policies into a single tabbed right SidePanel (`right_panel.rs`) â€” always-visible tab bar (200px collapsed), expands to 340px on tab click, re-click active tab to collapse
  - removed Roster/Upgrades/Policies toggle buttons from left HUD (now accessed via right panel tabs or R/U/P keys)
  - fixed combat log layout shift caused by non-deterministic egui system ordering â€” all egui systems now `.chain()` in one `add_systems` call: HUD (left) â†’ right panel â†’ bottom panel â†’ pause overlay
  - window starts maximized via `set_maximized(true)` startup system
  - old panel files (roster_panel.rs, upgrade_menu.rs, policies_panel.rs) no longer compiled, replaced by right_panel.rs

- **fix starving wounded oscillation + UI polish**
  - fix decision system oscillation: starving wounded NPCs looped between "Resting" and "Wounded â†’ Fountain" every frame because fountain healing can't exceed the 50% starvation HP cap â€” skip woundedâ†’fountain redirect when energy=0 so NPCs rest for energy first
  - fix arrival wounded check: if NPC is already Resting when wounded check fires, stamp `recover_until` threshold on existing state instead of redirecting to GoingToRest (prevents redirect loop at destination)
  - deselect NPC inspector when selected NPC dies (`death_cleanup_system` clears `SelectedNpc`)
  - persist combat log filter toggles to `UserSettings` JSON â€” filters load on init, save on change
  - main menu settings save now merges into existing file instead of overwriting (preserves log filters)
  - build menu opens at mouse cursor position (`fixed_pos` + `movable(false)`)

- **fix NPC inspector energy display + rebalance drain**
  - inspector energy bar was stuck at 100 â€” `NpcEnergyCache` resource was never synced
  - remove `NpcEnergyCache` entirely; HUD now queries `Energy` component directly (same pattern as HP)
  - change energy drain from 24h to 12h to empty â€” tighter rest/work cycle

- **energy-driven starvation**
  - remove `LastAteHour` component â€” energy is now the single survival resource
  - starvation triggers at energy=0 instead of 24h without eating
  - eating restores energy to 100 instantly (was +30)
  - starving speed penalty increased: 50% (was 75%)
  - starving HP cap unchanged at 50%
  - rest still works when starving (slow recovery, must walk home)
  - remove `keep_fed()` test helper and `STARVATION_HOURS`/`ENERGY_FROM_EATING` constants

- **stage 10: town policies**
  - add `TownPolicies` resource with `PolicySet` per town: flee thresholds, work schedule, off-duty behavior, healing priority
  - add `WorkSchedule` enum (Both/DayOnly/NightOnly) â€” gates work scoring in `decision_system` based on `GameTime.is_daytime()`
  - add `OffDutyBehavior` enum (GoToBed/StayAtFountain/WanderTown) â€” drives idle behavior when work is gated out
  - wire `policies_panel.rs` to `ResMut<TownPolicies>` â€” sliders/checkboxes directly mutate resource, removed `ui.disable()` and `Local<PolicyState>`
  - `decision_system` reads `Res<TownPolicies>` for policy-driven flee: guards use `guard_flee_hp`, farmers use `farmer_flee_hp`, raiders hardcoded 0.50
  - `guard_aggressive` disables guard flee, `farmer_fight_back` disables farmer flee
  - `guard_leash` policy controls whether guards return to post after combat (off = chase freely)
  - `prioritize_healing` sends wounded NPCs (HP < `recovery_hp`) to town fountain before resuming work
  - remove hardcoded `FleeThreshold(0.50)` and `WoundedThreshold(0.25)` from raider spawn â€” thresholds now policy-driven
  - fix `pseudo_random()` PRNG: old implementation discarded frame contribution via `>> 16` shift, causing identical rolls per NPC across frames (rest/wake loops). New xorshift mixing with Knuth's multiplicative hash (2654435761)

- **stage 9: upgrades & xp**
  - add `UpgradeQueue` resource + `process_upgrades_system`: UI pushes upgrade requests, system validates food cost, increments `TownUpgrades`, re-resolves `CachedStats` for affected NPCs
  - add `upgrade_cost(level) = 10 * 2^level` (doubles each level, capped at 20)
  - add last-hit XP tracking: `DamageMsg.attacker` â†’ `LastHitBy` component â†’ `xp_grant_system` grants 100 XP to killer on death
  - add `level_from_xp(xp) = floor(sqrt(xp/100))`, level multiplier `1.0 + level * 0.01` wired into `resolve_combat_stats()`
  - level-up rescales current HP proportionally to new max, emits `CombatEventKind::LevelUp` to combat log (cyan)
  - wire `upgrade_menu.rs`: functional buttons show level/cost, push to `UpgradeQueue`, disabled when unaffordable
  - wire `farm_growth_system`: applies FarmYield upgrade multiplier per-town
  - wire `healing_system`: applies HealingRate + FountainRadius upgrades per-town
  - fix `starvation_system` speed: uses `CachedStats.speed * 0.75` instead of hardcoded 60.0
  - fix `reassign_npc_system`: passes actual NPC level instead of hardcoded 0
  - fix NPC meta init: `level: 0` (was 1), aligned with `level_from_xp(0) == 0`
  - remove Stage 8 `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` parity checks
  - `game_hud.rs` NPC inspector shows XP and XP-to-next-level
  - `combat_log.rs` adds LevelUp filter checkbox + cyan color
  - `main_menu.rs` adds DragValue widgets alongside sliders for typeable config inputs

- **stage 8: data-driven stats**
  - add `systems/stats.rs`: `CombatConfig` resource with per-job `JobStats` + per-attack-type `AttackTypeStats`, `TownUpgrades` resource stub, `resolve_combat_stats()` resolver
  - add `CachedStats` component on all NPCs â€” resolved from config on spawn, replaces `AttackStats` + `MaxHealth`
  - add `BaseAttackType` enum (Melee/Ranged) as ECS component, keys into `CombatConfig.attacks` HashMap
  - remove `AttackStats` struct and `MaxHealth` struct â€” `CachedStats` is single source of truth
  - add `Hash` derive to `Job` (needed as HashMap key in CombatConfig)
  - wire `Personality::get_stat_multipliers()` into resolver (was defined but never called)
  - `attack_system` reads `&CachedStats` instead of `&AttackStats` (same query shape, data-driven)
  - `healing_system` reads `CombatConfig.heal_rate`/`heal_radius` instead of local constants, `&CachedStats` instead of `&MaxHealth`
  - `spawn_npc_system` and `reassign_npc_system` use resolver for all stats
  - UI queries (`game_hud.rs`, `roster_panel.rs`) and tests (`healing.rs`) migrated from `&MaxHealth` to `&CachedStats`
  - `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` parity checks: assert resolved stats match old hardcoded values
  - formula: `final_stat = base[job] * upgrade_mult * trait_mult * level_mult` (upgrades/levels all 1.0 in Stage 8)
  - init values match exactly: guard/raider damage=15, all speeds=100, all max_health=100, heal_rate=5, heal_radius=150

- **camera follow + target indicator**
  - add `FollowSelected(bool)` resource, `camera_follow_system` in `render.rs` â€” tracks selected NPC position
  - F key toggles follow mode, WASD cancels follow (natural override)
  - add "Follow (F)" selectable button in game HUD NPC inspector
  - add `target_overlay_system` using egui painter on background layer â€” yellow line + diamond to NPC's movement target, blue circle on NPC
  - bundle 8 readonly HUD resources into `HudData` SystemParam to stay under 16-param limit

- **performance: render world entity leak fix + scale-up**
  - fix render world entity leak: `extract_npc_batch` and `extract_proj_batch` now despawn stale entities before spawning fresh ones â€” previously accumulated one entity per frame, causing `command_buffer_generation_tasks` to grow linearly over time
  - scale GPU spatial grid from 128Ã—128Ã—64px (8,192px coverage) to 256Ã—256Ã—128px (32,768px coverage) â€” fixes NPCs not colliding or targeting on worlds larger than ~250Ã—250
  - raise max NPC count from 10K to 50K (both CPU `MAX_NPC_COUNT` and GPU `MAX_NPCS`)
  - remove dead CPU-side spatial grid constants from `constants.rs` (GRID_WIDTH/HEIGHT/CELLS, CELL_SIZE, MAX_PER_CELL â€” unused since GPU compute)
  - add chunked tilemap spec to roadmap (32Ã—32 tile chunks for off-screen culling, not yet implemented)

- **stage 7: playable game features**
  - add `settings.rs`: `UserSettings` resource with serde JSON save/load to `endless_settings.json` next to executable
  - main menu loads saved settings on init (world size, towns, farmers, guards, raiders), saves on Play click
  - `camera_pan_system` reads `UserSettings.scroll_speed` instead of hardcoded constant
  - add `reassign_npc_system` in `systems/spawn.rs`: Farmerâ†”Guard role swap via component add/remove
  - roster panel gets `â†’G` (farmerâ†’guard) and `â†’F` (guardâ†’farmer) buttons per NPC row
  - `ReassignQueue` resource bridges UI (EguiPrimaryContextPass) to ECS (Update schedule) since MessageWriter unavailable in egui schedule
  - reassignment swaps: job marker, equipment (sword/helmet), patrol route, work position, activity, sprite frame, population stats
  - equipment visuals update automatically via `sync_visual_sprites` (no manual GPU equipment update needed)
  - add `guard_post_attack_system` in `systems/combat.rs`: turret auto-attack fires projectiles at nearest enemy within 250px
  - `GuardPostState` resource with per-post cooldown timers and attack_enabled flags, auto-syncs length with WorldData.guard_posts
  - add turret toggle in build menu: right-click guard post shows "Disable/Enable Turret" button
  - add guard post turret constants: range=250, damage=8, cooldown=3s, proj_speed=300, proj_lifetime=1.5s
  - add `ReassignMsg` to messages.rs (defined but unused â€” `ReassignQueue` resource used instead)

- **building system playtesting fixes**
  - fix coordinate misalignment: TOWN_GRID_SPACING 34â†’32px (matches WorldGrid cell size), remove -0.5 offset from `town_grid_to_world` so slot (0,0) = town center
  - rewrite `place_town_buildings` to use town grid (row,col) coordinates instead of float offsets
  - fix right-click unresponsive for ~30s: remove `is_pointer_over_area()` guard (too aggressive near any egui panel), keep only `wants_pointer_input()`
  - widen slot click radius from 0.45 to 0.7 of TOWN_GRID_SPACING
  - fix crash on second game start: add bounds check `if raider_idx >= world_data.towns.len()` in spawn loop
  - replace gizmo slot indicators with Sprite entities (`SlotIndicator` marker) at z=-0.3 â€” gizmos render in separate pass after all Transparent2d items, can't be z-sorted with buildings/NPCs
  - green "+" crosshairs for empty unlocked slots, dim bracket corners for adjacent locked slots
  - NPC sort_key 0.0â†’0.5 (above indicators, below projectiles)
  - lower all building costs to 1 for testing
  - change defaults: 2 guards/town, 0 raiders/camp for peaceful testing
  - add Stage 8 spec: stat resolution, upgrades, XP, policies (4-phase plan)

- **building system: right-click context menu with per-tile slot unlock**
  - add `TownGrid`/`TownGrids` per-town slot tracking with `HashSet<(i32,i32)>` unlock system
  - add `BuildMenuContext` resource for right-click context menu state
  - add `place_building()` / `remove_building()` in world.rs with tombstone deletion (-99999 position)
  - add `find_town_slot()`, `get_adjacent_locked_slots()`, coordinate helpers (town_grid_to_world, world_to_town_grid)
  - add `BuildingChunk` marker + `sync_building_tilemap` system for runtime tilemap updates when WorldGrid changes
  - add `slot_right_click_system`: right-click town slot â†’ populate context â†’ open build menu
  - rewrite `build_menu_system` as context-driven menu: Farm/Bed/GuardPost build, Destroy, Unlock buttons with food costs
  - add `draw_slot_indicators` gizmo overlay: green "+" empty slots, dim brackets locked adjacent, gold ring town center
  - add building cost constants: Farm=50, Bed=10, GuardPost=25, SlotUnlock=25 food
  - add grid constants: TOWN_GRID_SPACING=34px, base grid 6x6 (-2..3), expandable to 100x100
  - guard posts get auto-incrementing patrol_order based on existing post count
  - ported from Godot's per-town grid system (scenes/main.gd, ui/build_menu.gd)

- **5 UI panels: roster, combat log, build menu, upgrades, policies**
  - `roster_panel.rs`: right side panel (R key) â€” NPC list with job filter (All/Farmers/Guards/Raiders), sortable column headers (Name/Job/Lv/HP/State/Trait with â–¼/â–² arrows), click-to-select, follow button moves camera to NPC, cached rows rebuild every 30 frames
  - `combat_log.rs`: bottom panel (L key) â€” event feed with color-coded timestamps (red=Kill, green=Spawn, orange=Raid, yellow=Harvest), filter checkboxes, auto-scroll, 200-entry ring buffer
  - `build_menu.rs`: floating window (B key) â€” Farm/Bed/GuardPost buttons with costs and tooltips, all disabled until Stage 7 backend
  - `upgrade_menu.rs`: floating window (U key) â€” 14 upgrade rows (Guard: Health/Attack/Range/Size/Speed/MoveSpeed/AlertRadius, Farm: Yield/FarmerHP/FarmerCap/GuardCap, Town: HealingRate/FoodEfficiency/FountainRadius), all disabled until Stage 8 backend
  - `policies_panel.rs`: floating window (P key) â€” checkboxes (Eat Food, Aggressive, Leash, Fight Back, Prioritize Healing), sliders (Farmer/Guard flee HP%, Recovery HP%), dropdowns (Work Schedule, Off-Duty behavior), all disabled until Stage 8 backend
  - add `UiState` resource (tracks which panels are open, combat_log defaults true)
  - add `CombatLog` resource (ring buffer VecDeque, max 200 entries, 4 event kinds)
  - add `ui_toggle_system` for keyboard shortcuts (R/L/B/U/P)
  - add panel toggle buttons to game HUD left panel (Roster/Log/Build/Upgrades/Policies)
  - add combat log emitters: `death_cleanup_system` â†’ Kill, `spawn_npc_system` â†’ Spawn (skip initial bulk), `decision_system` â†’ Raid dispatch, `arrival_system` â†’ Harvest
  - all panels ported from Godot originals (roster_panel.gd, combat_log.gd, build_menu.gd, upgrade_menu.gd, policies_panel.gd)


- **async GPU readback via Bevy `Readback` + `ReadbackComplete`**
  - replaces hand-rolled ping-pong staging buffers + blocking `device.poll(Wait)` (~9ms/frame)
  - 4 `ShaderStorageBuffer` assets as async readback targets (npc positions, combat targets, proj hits, proj positions)
  - `ReadbackComplete` observers write directly to `Res<GpuReadState>`, `Res<ProjHitState>`, `Res<ProjPositionState>`
  - deleted: `readback_all` (~140 lines), `StagingIndex`, 8 staging buffers, 3 static Mutexes
  - deleted: `sync_gpu_state_to_bevy` system + `systems/sync.rs` module
  - `GpuReadState` + `ProjPositionState` extracted to render world for instanced rendering
  - fix: proj hit readback buffer initialized with `[-1, 0]` per slot (zeroes misread as "hit NPC 0")
  - fix: `npc_count` no longer overwritten from readback (buffer is MAX-sized, actual count from `NpcCount` resource)

- **fix process_proj_hits iteration bounds and inactive skip**
  - iterate only up to `proj_alloc.next` (high-water mark) instead of full readback buffer
  - skip inactive projectiles (deactivated but stale in readback) via `proj_writes.active[slot] == 0` check
  - prevents wasted iteration over 50K unallocated slots

- **optimize per-frame visual sync and flash decay**
  - `sync_visual_sprites`: merged two-pass (clear all + set all) into single pass that writes defaults inline where components are absent, eliminating ~8K redundant array writes per frame at 500 NPCs
  - `populate_buffer_writes`: flash decay loop now iterates only active NPCs (npc_count) instead of all 16,384 MAX_NPCS slots
  - ~10% FPS improvement at 700+ NPCs (90 â†’ 100 FPS)

- **fix projectile slot leak (9 FPS â†’ 33+ FPS death spiral fix)**
  - expired projectiles now write `proj_hits[i] = (-2, 0)` sentinel in WGSL shader
  - `process_proj_hits` handles expired sentinel: frees slot + sends Deactivate
  - fixes death spiral where `ProjSlotAllocator.next` grew forever (never freed expired projectiles)
  - `command_buffer_generation_tasks` 24ms â†’ 9.8ms, `RenderExtractApp` 40ms â†’ 18ms

- **double-buffered ping-pong staging + unified readback**
  - `NpcGpuBuffers` and `ProjGpuBuffers` staging buffers changed from `Buffer` to `[Buffer; 2]`
  - `StagingIndex` resource tracks current/previous frame, flips each frame
  - compute nodes copy to `staging[current]`, readback reads `staging[1-current]`
  - unified `readback_all` replaces separate `readback_npc_positions` + `readback_proj_data`
  - single `device.poll()` maps all staging buffers (up to 4) in one call

- **per-index GPU uploads replace full-array uploads**
  - `NpcBufferWrites`: per-field boolean dirty flags â†’ `Vec<usize>` dirty indices
  - `write_npc_buffers`: per-index `write_buffer` calls (8-byte writes instead of 128KB bulk)
  - `ProjBufferWrites`: per-slot `spawn_dirty_indices` and `deactivate_dirty_indices`
  - `write_proj_buffers`: spawn writes all fields per slot, deactivate writes only active+hits

- **equipment tinted with job color**
  - equipment layers (armor, helmet, weapon, item) now use job RGBA tint instead of white
  - guards' equipment renders blue, raiders' red â€” visually distinct at a glance

- **brighter job colors for tint-based rendering**
  - all job colors brightened (e.g. farmer 0.2,0.8,0.2 â†’ 0.4,1.0,0.4)
  - raider faction palette raised (10 colors, min component ~0.4 instead of ~0.1)
  - tint-multiplication on white sprites needs brighter base colors to look vivid

- **add tracy profiling feature**
  - `tracy = ["bevy/trace_tracy"]` feature flag in Cargo.toml
  - build with `--features tracy` to enable Tracy instrumented spans

- **two-enum state machine: Activity + CombatState replace 13 marker components**
  - add `Activity` enum (Idle, Working, OnDuty, Patrolling, GoingToWork, GoingToRest, Resting, Wandering, Raiding, Returning) â€” models what NPC is *doing*
  - add `CombatState` enum (None, Fighting, Fleeing) â€” models whether NPC is *fighting*
  - concurrent state machines pattern: Activity preserved through combat (Raiding NPC stays Raiding while Fighting)
  - `Activity::is_transit()` replaces `HasTarget` marker â€” arrival detection derived from enum state
  - `Returning { has_food }` replaces `CarryingFood` marker â€” food state folded into activity
  - `Resting { recover_until: Some(t) }` replaces `Recovering` component â€” recovery folded into rest
  - remove 13 components: HasTarget, Working, OnDuty, Patrolling, GoingToWork, GoingToRest, Resting, Wandering, Raiding, Returning, InCombat, CombatOrigin, CarryingFood
  - remove `NpcStateParams` and `CombatParams` SystemParam bundles (enum queries replace marker queries)
  - update all 18 files: components, lib, 6 systems, gpu, ui, 8 tests
  - fix Bevy B0001 query conflict: `Without<AssignedFarm>` on arrival_system returning query for disjointness
  - cargo check: 0 errors, 0 warnings; cargo run --release: launches clean

- **fix terrain z-ordering: AlphaMode2d::Opaque â†’ Blend**
  - terrain was rendering over NPCs because Opaque2d phase executes after Transparent2d regardless of z-value
  - both tilemap layers now use AlphaMode2d::Blend in Transparent2d phase (terrain z=-1.0, buildings z=-0.5, NPCs sort_key=0.0)

- **NPC debug inspector with clipboard copy**
  - add full debug section to game HUD: position, target, home, faction, all state components, recent log entries
  - add "Copy Debug Info" button using `arboard::Clipboard` directly (bevy_egui `EguiClipboard`/`ctx.copy_text()` didn't work)
  - add `NpcStateQuery` SystemParam bundle for querying 15 state marker components
  - guard `click_to_select_system` with `ctx.wants_pointer_input() || ctx.is_pointer_over_area()` â€” prevents game click handler from stealing egui button clicks (was deselecting NPC on same frame as Copy button press)
  - add `arboard = "3"` dependency

## 2026-02-09
- **main game mode: menu â†’ world gen â†’ play â†’ HUD â†’ cleanup cycle**
  - add `AppState` to `lib.rs` with 4 states: MainMenu (default), Playing, TestMenu, Running
  - game systems gated on `Playing | Running` via `.or()` run condition (shared between real game and debug tests)
  - add `ui/main_menu.rs`: egui main menu with world config sliders (size, towns, farmers, guards, raiders) + Play / Debug Tests buttons
  - add `ui/game_hud.rs`: egui side panel HUD with game time, population stats, food, kill stats, NPC inspector (HP/energy bars, job, trait, town)
  - add `ui/mod.rs`: game startup (OnEnter Playing) generates world + spawns NPCs per town, game cleanup (OnExit Playing) despawns all entities + resets resources, ESC/Space/+/- controls
  - add `TilemapSpawned` Resource (replaces `Local<bool>`) so cleanup can reset it for re-entry
  - change tilemap z-ordering: terrain -1.0â†’-100.0, buildings -0.5â†’-99.0 (NPCs were rendering under terrain)
  - add "Back to Menu" button in test menu alongside "Run All"
  - `CleanupWorld` + `CleanupDebug` SystemParam bundles keep cleanup system under 16-param limit
  - known issue: NPCs still render under terrain despite z-ordering change (needs further investigation)

- **sync_visual_sprites: derive visual state from ECS, remove redundant GPU messages**
  - add `sync_visual_sprites` system (gpu.rs): derives colors, equipment, indicators from ECS components each frame
  - remove 4 GpuUpdate variants: SetColor, SetHealing, SetSleeping, SetEquipSprite â€” visual state no longer deferred via messages
  - remove SetColor/SetEquipSprite sends from spawn_npc_system, decision_system, arrival_system, death_cleanup_system
  - remove SetHealing sends from healing_system â€” visual derived from Healing marker component
  - remove SetSleeping sends from decision_system â€” visual derived from Resting marker component
  - consolidate RAIDER_COLORS palette + `raider_faction_color()` to constants.rs (was duplicated in spawn.rs + behavior.rs)
  - healing_system: remove Healing marker when NPC fully healed (was only removed when leaving zone)
  - all 15 tests pass at time_scale=1 (no accelerated time), build clean with 0 warnings

- **fix 6 timed-out tests at time_scale=1**
  - energy: spawn with home=(-1,-1) so rest_score=0; start energy=55; completes in 6s
  - guard-patrol: start energy=40; P5 timeout 40s for recovery walk time; completes in 33s
  - farmer-cycle: start energy=35; P5 checks resting==0 not going_work; completes in 25s
  - sleep-visual: start energy=35; schedule tick after sync_visual_sprites; completes in 25s
  - economy: farm progress 0.5â†’0.95; completes in 30s
  - farm-visual: farm progress 0.8â†’0.95; completes in 1.5s
  - key pattern: set initial energy via mutable query + flag on first tick (avoids racing spawn frame)

- **suppress debug tick spam across test runs**
  - remove explicit `flags.combat=true` / `flags.readback=true` from vertical_slice, combat, projectiles test setups
  - add DebugFlags reset to `cleanup_test_world` (CleanupExtra bundle) â€” prevents flag bleed between tests

- **stage 6 green phase: visual indicator render layers + test refactor**
  - add 2 new render layers: Status (layer 5, sleep icon) and Healing (layer 6, heal glow)
  - LAYER_COUNT 5â†’7, EquipLayer enum extended with Status=4 and Healing=5
  - wire SetHealing to write HEAL_SPRITE to `healing_sprites` buffer (was no-op)
  - add SetSleeping message, sent from behavior.rs at 3 Resting insert/remove sites
  - add `farm_visual_system`: spawns/despawns FarmReadyMarker on farm state transitions
  - update sleep/heal visual tests to check dedicated buffers (`status_sprites`/`healing_sprites`)
  - refactor test infrastructure: TestSetupParams SystemParam bundle, tick_elapsed/require_entity/keep_fed helpers (-278 lines)
  - heal-visual phases 1-2 pass; sleep-visual and farm-visual still have timing issues to debug

- **fix healing test: all 3 phases pass**
  - keep farmer fed each tick (`LastAteHour = total_hours`) â€” isolates healing from starvation
  - healing was 2/3 (hp regressed due to starvation HP cap), now ALL PASS
  - all 12 behavior tests pass; 3 visual indicator red tests remain (expected)

- **review fixes for visual indicator tests**
  - `sleep_visual.rs`: add missing FarmStates init, fix `starting_post: 0` â†’ `-1`
  - `mod.rs`: add FarmReadyMarker cleanup to `cleanup_test_world`

- **fix guard-patrol test: all 5 phases pass**
  - tired guards now leave post (Priority 6 energy check) and fall through to rest scoring
  - test keeps guard fed via `LastAteHour` reset each tick â€” isolates duty cycle from starvation
  - guard-patrol was 3/5, now ALL PASS

- **gate tick spam behind debug flag**
  - "Tick: N NPCs active" log now requires `flags.readback` (F1) to be on
  - merge the NPC count log into the readback block â€” no output unless F1 toggled

- **visual indicator test infrastructure (red tests)**
  - add `sleep_visual.rs`: resting NPC gets SLEEP_SPRITE on item layer, cleared on wake (3 phases)
  - add `farm_visual.rs`: ready farm spawns FarmReadyMarker entity, removed on harvest (3 phases)
  - add `heal_visual.rs`: healing NPC gets HEAL_SPRITE on item layer, cleared when healed (3 phases)
  - add `FarmReadyMarker` component, `SLEEP_SPRITE` and `HEAL_SPRITE` constants
  - tests are expected to fail Phase 2 until visual systems write to `item_sprites`/spawn markers

- **require(HasTarget) on transit components: compile-time arrival detection guarantee**
  - add `#[require(HasTarget)]` to 6 transit components (Patrolling, GoingToRest, GoingToWork, Raiding, Returning, Wandering)
  - add `Default` derive to `HasTarget` (required by `#[require]`)
  - remove 13 manual `.insert(HasTarget)` calls from `decision_system` and 1 from `spawn_npc_system`
  - Bevy's required components auto-insert `HasTarget` on any `.insert(Patrolling)` etc â€” impossible to forget

- **camera: eliminate CameraState duplication, Bevy camera is single source of truth**
  - remove `CameraState` from main world (`init_resource`, `ExtractResourcePlugin`)
  - remove `camera_viewport_sync` and `camera_transform_sync` systems (6 systems â†’ 4)
  - `camera_pan_system` and `camera_zoom_system` write directly to `Transform` + `Projection`
  - `click_to_select_system` reads `Transform` + `Projection` instead of `CameraState`
  - add `extract_camera_state` in render world ExtractSchedule: reads Camera2d entity â†’ builds CameraState for shader
  - add `ortho_zoom()` helper: reads zoom from `Projection::Orthographic.scale`

- **building tilemap: two-layer TilemapChunk (terrain + buildings)**
  - buildings now rendered via second TilemapChunk layer (z=-0.5, AlphaMode2d::Blend) on top of terrain (z=-1, Opaque)
  - generic `build_tileset(atlas, tiles, images)` replaces `build_terrain_tileset()` â€” same pixel-copy logic, parameterized by tile list
  - add `BUILDING_TILES` const (5 atlas positions: fountain, bed, guard post, farm, camp)
  - add `Building::tileset_index()` mapping building variant to tileset array index
  - add `spawn_chunk()` DRY helper in render.rs, called twice for terrain and building layers
  - rename `spawn_terrain_tilemap` â†’ `spawn_world_tilemap`
  - remove `WorldRenderInstances` resource, `compute_world_render_instances` system, `ExtractResourcePlugin` from instanced renderer
  - `LAYER_COUNT` 6â†’5: body(0), armor(1), helmet(2), weapon(3), item(4) â€” buildings no longer instanced
  - remove dead code from world.rs: `SpriteDef`, `LocationType`, `SpriteInstance`, `get_all_sprites()`, sprite constants

- **terrain tilemap: migrate 62K instanced terrain to TilemapChunk**
  - terrain rendered via Bevy's built-in `TilemapChunk` (single quad, fragment shader tile lookup, zero per-frame CPU cost)
  - `build_terrain_tileset()`: extracts 11 terrain tiles from world atlas into `texture_2d_array` at runtime
  - `Biome::tileset_index()`: maps biome + cell position to tileset array index (0-10)
  - `spawn_terrain_tilemap` system: spawns TilemapChunk entity when WorldGrid populated + atlas loaded
  - remove terrain from instanced pipeline: `LAYER_COUNT` 7â†’6, `WorldRenderInstances` buildings-only
  - remove dead `Biome::sprite()` method (replaced by tileset_index)
  - add FPS counter overlay (egui, bottom-left, EMA-smoothed)
  - suppress tick log when 0 NPCs active

- **unified instanced renderer: terrain + buildings + NPCs in one pipeline**
  - rename `NpcInstanceData` â†’ `InstanceData`, add `scale` (per-instance quad size) and `atlas_id` (atlas selection) fields (40â†’48 bytes)
  - bind both character and world atlases simultaneously (group 0, bindings 0-3)
  - shader selects atlas per-instance: character (NPCs/equipment/projectiles) or world (terrain/buildings)
  - add `WorldRenderInstances` resource: pre-computed terrain + building instances, extracted to render world
  - add `compute_world_render_instances` system: builds 62,500 terrain + ~42 building instances from WorldGrid
  - add `Biome::sprite(cell_index)` method for deterministic terrain sprite variation
  - `LAYER_COUNT` 5â†’7: terrain (0), buildings (1), NPC body (2), equipment (3-6)
  - world-gen test now renders visible terrain tiles and buildings
  - tests stay running after pass/fail (single test mode) â€” user clicks Back to return

- **fix arrival detection: consolidate to single targeting path**
  - remove dead `SetTargetMsg` + `apply_targets_system` (redundant O(n) entity scan, nobody wrote SetTargetMsg)
  - remove dead `ArrivalMsg` + `ARRIVAL_QUEUE` + `drain_arrival_queue` (nothing ever wrote to the queue)
  - remove ArrivalMsg event-reading section from `arrival_system` (now proximity checks only)
  - add `HasTarget` insert at all 13 transit points in `decision_system` (was missing â€” arrival detection required it)
  - single targeting path: `decision_system` writes `GpuUpdate::SetTarget` + inserts `HasTarget` â†’ `gpu_position_readback` detects arrival â†’ `AtDestination`
  - fixes guard-patrol Phase 3, farmer-cycle Phase 5, raider-cycle Phase 2, combat Phase 5, projectiles Phase 3
  - 4 previously-failing tests now fully pass (farmer-cycle, raider-cycle, combat, projectiles)


- **world grid + procedural generation (TDD)**
  - add `WorldGrid` resource: 250x250 cell grid (32px/cell) covering 8000x8000 world
  - add `WorldCell` with `Biome` (Grass/Forest/Water/Rock/Dirt) + `Option<Building>` layers
  - add `Building` enum: Fountain, Farm, Bed, GuardPost, Camp (each with town_idx)
  - add `WorldGenConfig` resource with defaults (2 towns, 1200px spacing, 1100px camp distance)
  - add `generate_world()` pure function: random town placement, camp positioning, simplex terrain, building layout
  - add terrain generation via `noise` crate (simplex noise, Dirt override near settlements)
  - add `world_gen.rs` test (6 phases): grid dimensions, town count, distances, buildings, terrain, camps
  - add `rand` 0.9 and `noise` 0.9 dependencies
  - all 6 test phases pass

- **stage 5: write 10 test suites**
  - add `spawning.rs`: spawn 5 NPCs, kill one, verify slot freed and reused (4 phases)

  - add `Debug` derive to `FarmGrowthState` (needed for test display)

- **test framework (stage 5)**
  - add UI-selectable test menu via bevy_egui (`EguiPrimaryContextPass` schedule)
  - add `AppState` (TestMenu | Running) â€” all game systems gated on `in_state(Running)`
  - add `TestState`, `TestRegistry`, `RunAllState` resources for test lifecycle
  - add `test_is("name")` run condition for per-test system gating
  - add test HUD: phase checklist overlay with `â—‹` pending, `â–¶` active, `âœ“` passed, `âœ—` failed
  - add Run All: sequential test execution with summary on completion
  - add `CleanupCore`/`CleanupExtra` SystemParam bundles (avoids 16-param limit)

  - add 4 equipment sprite Vec fields to NpcBufferWrites (stride 2, -1.0 sentinel), route by EquipLayer in apply() (gpu.rs)
  - refactor NpcRenderBuffers: single instance_buffer â†’ Vec<LayerBuffer> with 5 layers (npc_render.rs)
  - DrawNpcs draws all non-empty layers sequentially (body â†’ armor â†’ helmet â†’ weapon â†’ item)
  - npc_render.wgsl: equipment layers (health >= 0.99) discard bottom pixels to preserve health bar
  - spawn clears all equipment, then sets job-specific gear: guards get sword+helmet, raiders get sword
  - death_cleanup clears all 4 equipment layers on death (prevents stale slot data)
  - behavior.rs: SetCarriedItem â†’ SetEquipSprite(Item) for food carry/deliver
  - test 12 passes

- **damage flash (white overlay on hit, fade out)**
  - add `SetDamageFlash { idx, intensity }` to GpuUpdate enum (messages.rs)
  - add `flash_values: Vec<f32>` to NpcBufferWrites, handle in apply(), decay at 5.0/s in populate_buffer_writes (gpu.rs)
  - damage_system sends SetDamageFlash(1.0) after SetHealth (health.rs)
  - add `flash: f32` to NpcInstanceData (36 â†’ 40 bytes), vertex attribute @location(6) (npc_render.rs)
  - npc_render.wgsl: add flash to vertex I/O, mix(color, white, flash) in fragment shader
  - test 12 passes

- **health bars + projectile sprite**
  - add `health: f32` to NpcInstanceData (32 â†’ 36 bytes), vertex attribute @location(5)
  - prepare_npc_buffers reads NpcBufferWrites.healths, normalizes by /100.0
  - prepare_proj_buffers sets health=1.0 (no bar on projectiles)
  - npc_render.wgsl: pass quad_uv + health through vertex shader, 3-color health bar in bottom 15% of sprite (green >50%, yellow >25%, red â‰¤25%), show-when-damaged mode

  - pan speed 400px/s scaled by 1/zoom, scroll zoom factor 0.1 toward mouse cursor (range 0.1â€“4.0)
  - click-to-select: screen-to-world via CameraState, nearest NPC within 20px from GPU_READ_STATE
  - delete old .glsl shaders and .zip archive (cleanup)
  - test 12 passes (2.3s)

- **port separation physics from glsl to wgsl compute shader**
  - boids-style separation force: 3x3 grid neighbor scan, asymmetric push (moving=0.2x, settled=2.0x), golden angle for exact overlap
  - TCP-style dodge: perpendicular avoidance for converging NPCs (head-on/crossing/overtaking), consistent side-picking via index comparison
  - backoff persistence: blocked NPCs slow down exponentially (persistence = 1/(1+backoff)), blocking detection via push/goal alignment
  - backoff buffer (binding 6) now read/written by shader â€” was allocated but unused
  - all params now active: separation_radius, separation_strength, grid_width/height, cell_size, max_per_cell
  - combat targeting unchanged (wider search radius than GLSL version)
  - test 12 still passes (5.3s, down from 6.8s)

## 2026-02-08

  - all 8 phases pass in 6.8s at time_scale=10
  - fix: add CPU-side arrival detection in gpu_position_readback (position vs goal within ARRIVAL_THRESHOLD â†’ AtDestination)
  - fix: add HasTarget component to farmers at spawn (was missing, blocking arrival detection)
  - ARRIVAL_QUEUE static is now unused â€” replaced by CPU-side arrival detection in movement.rs

- **docs: authority model and roadmap restructure**
  - messages.md: Data Ownership â†’ Data Ownership & Authority Model with 4 categories (GPU-authoritative, CPU-authoritative, CPU-only, render-only)

  - attack_system: reads GPU combat_targets, fires projectiles via PROJ_GPU_UPDATE_QUEUE or applies point-blank damage
  - projectile hit readback: hit_staging buffer, readback_proj_hits system, PROJ_HIT_STATE static
  - process_proj_hits: converts hits to DamageMsg, recycles projectile slots
  - arrival flag reset: SetTarget resets arrivals[idx]=0 so GPU resumes movement toward chase targets
  - ProjBufferWrites default dirty=true for first-frame -1 hit initialization
  - Deactivate also resets hits buffer to -1 to prevent re-triggers
  - test_spawn_combat: 5v5 faction fighters for combat pipeline verification
  - debug_tick_system: F2 combat logging shows targets/attacks/chases/deaths per second
  - verified: NPCs find targets (9/10), chase out-of-range enemies, point-blank damage reduces NPC count

- **gpuâ†’ecs position readback + debug flags**
  - add staging buffer (MAP_READ | COPY_DST) to NpcGpuBuffers for position readback
  - copy positions to staging after compute dispatch in NpcComputeNode

  - add projectile compute pipeline to gpu.rs: ProjGpuBuffers (8 buffers), ProjComputeParams, ProjBufferWrites, ProjectileComputeNode
  - render graph: NpcCompute â†’ ProjectileCompute â†’ CameraDriver (grid built before projectile reads it)
  - projectile bind group shares NPC buffers (positions, factions, healths, grid) as read-only
  - pipeline compiles and dispatches; no-op with proj_count=0

- **restructure: flatten project layout**
  - flatten gpu/mod.rs â†’ gpu.rs, render/mod.rs â†’ render.rs (single-file modules don't need folders)
  - move shaders from assets/shaders/ to root shaders/ (all shaders in one place)
  - delete Godot .import files from assets/
  - change asset root to project root (asset_server loads from ".." instead of "../assets")
  - update texture load paths with assets/ prefix

  - disable old render graph Node pipeline in gpu/mod.rs (replaced by RenderCommand pattern)
  - 5 test NPCs visible as green squares via instanced draw call
  - enable sprite texture sampling in fragment shader (was solid color debug)
  - fix UV flip: remove incorrect 1.0-v inversion (wgpu uses top-left origin)
  - fix instance count: use NpcGpuData.npc_count instead of buffer length (was rendering all MAX_NPCS slots)

- **pure bevy migration phase 2-3**: wire ECS systems, add GPU compute and sprite rendering
  - wire build_app() into main.rs, verify systems tick with debug logging
  - add gpu/mod.rs: GPU compute via Bevy render graph (follows game_of_life pattern)
