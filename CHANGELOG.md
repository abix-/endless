# Changelog

## 2026-02-10

- **stage 8: data-driven stats**
  - add `systems/stats.rs`: `CombatConfig` resource with per-job `JobStats` + per-attack-type `AttackTypeStats`, `TownUpgrades` resource stub, `resolve_combat_stats()` resolver
  - add `CachedStats` component on all NPCs — resolved from config on spawn, replaces `AttackStats` + `MaxHealth`
  - add `BaseAttackType` enum (Melee/Ranged) as ECS component, keys into `CombatConfig.attacks` HashMap
  - remove `AttackStats` struct and `MaxHealth` struct — `CachedStats` is single source of truth
  - add `Hash` derive to `Job` (needed as HashMap key in CombatConfig)
  - wire `Personality::get_stat_multipliers()` into resolver (was defined but never called)
  - `attack_system` reads `&CachedStats` instead of `&AttackStats` (same query shape, data-driven)
  - `healing_system` reads `CombatConfig.heal_rate`/`heal_radius` instead of local constants, `&CachedStats` instead of `&MaxHealth`
  - `spawn_npc_system` and `reassign_npc_system` use resolver for all stats
  - UI queries (`game_hud.rs`, `roster_panel.rs`) and tests (`healing.rs`) migrated from `&MaxHealth` to `&CachedStats`
  - `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` parity checks: assert resolved stats match old hardcoded values
  - formula: `final_stat = base[job] * upgrade_mult * trait_mult * level_mult` (upgrades/levels all 1.0 in Stage 8)
  - init values match exactly: guard/raider damage=15, all speeds=100, all max_health=100, heal_rate=5, heal_radius=150

- **camera follow + target indicator**
  - add `FollowSelected(bool)` resource, `camera_follow_system` in `render.rs` — tracks selected NPC position
  - F key toggles follow mode, WASD cancels follow (natural override)
  - add "Follow (F)" selectable button in game HUD NPC inspector
  - add `target_overlay_system` using egui painter on background layer — yellow line + diamond to NPC's movement target, blue circle on NPC
  - bundle 8 readonly HUD resources into `HudData` SystemParam to stay under 16-param limit

- **performance: render world entity leak fix + scale-up**
  - fix render world entity leak: `extract_npc_batch` and `extract_proj_batch` now despawn stale entities before spawning fresh ones — previously accumulated one entity per frame, causing `command_buffer_generation_tasks` to grow linearly over time
  - scale GPU spatial grid from 128×128×64px (8,192px coverage) to 256×256×128px (32,768px coverage) — fixes NPCs not colliding or targeting on worlds larger than ~250×250
  - raise max NPC count from 10K to 50K (both CPU `MAX_NPC_COUNT` and GPU `MAX_NPCS`)
  - remove dead CPU-side spatial grid constants from `constants.rs` (GRID_WIDTH/HEIGHT/CELLS, CELL_SIZE, MAX_PER_CELL — unused since GPU compute)
  - add chunked tilemap spec to roadmap (32×32 tile chunks for off-screen culling, not yet implemented)

- **stage 7: playable game features**
  - add `settings.rs`: `UserSettings` resource with serde JSON save/load to `endless_settings.json` next to executable
  - main menu loads saved settings on init (world size, towns, farmers, guards, raiders), saves on Play click
  - `camera_pan_system` reads `UserSettings.scroll_speed` instead of hardcoded constant
  - add `reassign_npc_system` in `systems/spawn.rs`: Farmer↔Guard role swap via component add/remove
  - roster panel gets `→G` (farmer→guard) and `→F` (guard→farmer) buttons per NPC row
  - `ReassignQueue` resource bridges UI (EguiPrimaryContextPass) to ECS (Update schedule) since MessageWriter unavailable in egui schedule
  - reassignment swaps: job marker, equipment (sword/helmet), patrol route, work position, activity, sprite frame, population stats
  - equipment visuals update automatically via `sync_visual_sprites` (no manual GPU equipment update needed)
  - add `guard_post_attack_system` in `systems/combat.rs`: turret auto-attack fires projectiles at nearest enemy within 250px
  - `GuardPostState` resource with per-post cooldown timers and attack_enabled flags, auto-syncs length with WorldData.guard_posts
  - add turret toggle in build menu: right-click guard post shows "Disable/Enable Turret" button
  - add guard post turret constants: range=250, damage=8, cooldown=3s, proj_speed=300, proj_lifetime=1.5s
  - add `ReassignMsg` to messages.rs (defined but unused — `ReassignQueue` resource used instead)

- **building system playtesting fixes**
  - fix coordinate misalignment: TOWN_GRID_SPACING 34→32px (matches WorldGrid cell size), remove -0.5 offset from `town_grid_to_world` so slot (0,0) = town center
  - rewrite `place_town_buildings` to use town grid (row,col) coordinates instead of float offsets
  - fix right-click unresponsive for ~30s: remove `is_pointer_over_area()` guard (too aggressive near any egui panel), keep only `wants_pointer_input()`
  - widen slot click radius from 0.45 to 0.7 of TOWN_GRID_SPACING
  - fix crash on second game start: add bounds check `if raider_idx >= world_data.towns.len()` in spawn loop
  - replace gizmo slot indicators with Sprite entities (`SlotIndicator` marker) at z=-0.3 — gizmos render in separate pass after all Transparent2d items, can't be z-sorted with buildings/NPCs
  - green "+" crosshairs for empty unlocked slots, dim bracket corners for adjacent locked slots
  - NPC sort_key 0.0→0.5 (above indicators, below projectiles)
  - lower all building costs to 1 for testing
  - change defaults: 2 guards/town, 0 raiders/camp for peaceful testing
  - add Stage 8 spec: stat resolution, upgrades, XP, policies (4-phase plan)

- **building system: right-click context menu with per-tile slot unlock**
  - add `TownGrid`/`TownGrids` per-town slot tracking with `HashSet<(i32,i32)>` unlock system
  - add `BuildMenuContext` resource for right-click context menu state
  - add `place_building()` / `remove_building()` in world.rs with tombstone deletion (-99999 position)
  - add `find_town_slot()`, `get_adjacent_locked_slots()`, coordinate helpers (town_grid_to_world, world_to_town_grid)
  - add `BuildingChunk` marker + `sync_building_tilemap` system for runtime tilemap updates when WorldGrid changes
  - add `slot_right_click_system`: right-click town slot → populate context → open build menu
  - rewrite `build_menu_system` as context-driven menu: Farm/Bed/GuardPost build, Destroy, Unlock buttons with food costs
  - add `draw_slot_indicators` gizmo overlay: green "+" empty slots, dim brackets locked adjacent, gold ring town center
  - add building cost constants: Farm=50, Bed=10, GuardPost=25, SlotUnlock=25 food
  - add grid constants: TOWN_GRID_SPACING=34px, base grid 6x6 (-2..3), expandable to 100x100
  - guard posts get auto-incrementing patrol_order based on existing post count
  - ported from Godot's per-town grid system (scenes/main.gd, ui/build_menu.gd)

- **5 UI panels: roster, combat log, build menu, upgrades, policies**
  - `roster_panel.rs`: right side panel (R key) — NPC list with job filter (All/Farmers/Guards/Raiders), sortable column headers (Name/Job/Lv/HP/State/Trait with ▼/▲ arrows), click-to-select, follow button moves camera to NPC, cached rows rebuild every 30 frames
  - `combat_log.rs`: bottom panel (L key) — event feed with color-coded timestamps (red=Kill, green=Spawn, orange=Raid, yellow=Harvest), filter checkboxes, auto-scroll, 200-entry ring buffer
  - `build_menu.rs`: floating window (B key) — Farm/Bed/GuardPost buttons with costs and tooltips, all disabled until Stage 7 backend
  - `upgrade_menu.rs`: floating window (U key) — 14 upgrade rows (Guard: Health/Attack/Range/Size/Speed/MoveSpeed/AlertRadius, Farm: Yield/FarmerHP/FarmerCap/GuardCap, Town: HealingRate/FoodEfficiency/FountainRadius), all disabled until Stage 8 backend
  - `policies_panel.rs`: floating window (P key) — checkboxes (Eat Food, Aggressive, Leash, Fight Back, Prioritize Healing), sliders (Farmer/Guard flee HP%, Recovery HP%), dropdowns (Work Schedule, Off-Duty behavior), all disabled until Stage 8 backend
  - add `UiState` resource (tracks which panels are open, combat_log defaults true)
  - add `CombatLog` resource (ring buffer VecDeque, max 200 entries, 4 event kinds)
  - add `ui_toggle_system` for keyboard shortcuts (R/L/B/U/P)
  - add panel toggle buttons to game HUD left panel (Roster/Log/Build/Upgrades/Policies)
  - add combat log emitters: `death_cleanup_system` → Kill, `spawn_npc_system` → Spawn (skip initial bulk), `decision_system` → Raid dispatch, `arrival_system` → Harvest
  - all panels ported from Godot originals (roster_panel.gd, combat_log.gd, build_menu.gd, upgrade_menu.gd, policies_panel.gd)


- **async GPU readback via Bevy `Readback` + `ReadbackComplete`**
  - replaces hand-rolled ping-pong staging buffers + blocking `device.poll(Wait)` (~9ms/frame)
  - 4 `ShaderStorageBuffer` assets as async readback targets (npc positions, combat targets, proj hits, proj positions)
  - `ReadbackComplete` observers write directly to `Res<GpuReadState>`, `Res<ProjHitState>`, `Res<ProjPositionState>`
  - deleted: `readback_all` (~140 lines), `StagingIndex`, 8 staging buffers, 3 static Mutexes
  - deleted: `sync_gpu_state_to_bevy` system + `systems/sync.rs` module
  - `GpuReadState` + `ProjPositionState` extracted to render world for instanced rendering
  - fix: proj hit readback buffer initialized with `[-1, 0]` per slot (zeroes misread as "hit NPC 0")
  - fix: `npc_count` no longer overwritten from readback (buffer is MAX-sized, actual count from `NpcCount` resource)

- **fix process_proj_hits iteration bounds and inactive skip**
  - iterate only up to `proj_alloc.next` (high-water mark) instead of full readback buffer
  - skip inactive projectiles (deactivated but stale in readback) via `proj_writes.active[slot] == 0` check
  - prevents wasted iteration over 50K unallocated slots

- **optimize per-frame visual sync and flash decay**
  - `sync_visual_sprites`: merged two-pass (clear all + set all) into single pass that writes defaults inline where components are absent, eliminating ~8K redundant array writes per frame at 500 NPCs
  - `populate_buffer_writes`: flash decay loop now iterates only active NPCs (npc_count) instead of all 16,384 MAX_NPCS slots
  - ~10% FPS improvement at 700+ NPCs (90 → 100 FPS)

- **fix projectile slot leak (9 FPS → 33+ FPS death spiral fix)**
  - expired projectiles now write `proj_hits[i] = (-2, 0)` sentinel in WGSL shader
  - `process_proj_hits` handles expired sentinel: frees slot + sends Deactivate
  - fixes death spiral where `ProjSlotAllocator.next` grew forever (never freed expired projectiles)
  - `command_buffer_generation_tasks` 24ms → 9.8ms, `RenderExtractApp` 40ms → 18ms

- **double-buffered ping-pong staging + unified readback**
  - `NpcGpuBuffers` and `ProjGpuBuffers` staging buffers changed from `Buffer` to `[Buffer; 2]`
  - `StagingIndex` resource tracks current/previous frame, flips each frame
  - compute nodes copy to `staging[current]`, readback reads `staging[1-current]`
  - unified `readback_all` replaces separate `readback_npc_positions` + `readback_proj_data`
  - single `device.poll()` maps all staging buffers (up to 4) in one call

- **per-index GPU uploads replace full-array uploads**
  - `NpcBufferWrites`: per-field boolean dirty flags → `Vec<usize>` dirty indices
  - `write_npc_buffers`: per-index `write_buffer` calls (8-byte writes instead of 128KB bulk)
  - `ProjBufferWrites`: per-slot `spawn_dirty_indices` and `deactivate_dirty_indices`
  - `write_proj_buffers`: spawn writes all fields per slot, deactivate writes only active+hits

- **equipment tinted with job color**
  - equipment layers (armor, helmet, weapon, item) now use job RGBA tint instead of white
  - guards' equipment renders blue, raiders' red — visually distinct at a glance

- **brighter job colors for tint-based rendering**
  - all job colors brightened (e.g. farmer 0.2,0.8,0.2 → 0.4,1.0,0.4)
  - raider faction palette raised (10 colors, min component ~0.4 instead of ~0.1)
  - tint-multiplication on white sprites needs brighter base colors to look vivid

- **add tracy profiling feature**
  - `tracy = ["bevy/trace_tracy"]` feature flag in Cargo.toml
  - build with `--features tracy` to enable Tracy instrumented spans

- **two-enum state machine: Activity + CombatState replace 13 marker components**
  - add `Activity` enum (Idle, Working, OnDuty, Patrolling, GoingToWork, GoingToRest, Resting, Wandering, Raiding, Returning) — models what NPC is *doing*
  - add `CombatState` enum (None, Fighting, Fleeing) — models whether NPC is *fighting*
  - concurrent state machines pattern: Activity preserved through combat (Raiding NPC stays Raiding while Fighting)
  - `Activity::is_transit()` replaces `HasTarget` marker — arrival detection derived from enum state
  - `Returning { has_food }` replaces `CarryingFood` marker — food state folded into activity
  - `Resting { recover_until: Some(t) }` replaces `Recovering` component — recovery folded into rest
  - remove 13 components: HasTarget, Working, OnDuty, Patrolling, GoingToWork, GoingToRest, Resting, Wandering, Raiding, Returning, InCombat, CombatOrigin, CarryingFood
  - remove `NpcStateParams` and `CombatParams` SystemParam bundles (enum queries replace marker queries)
  - update all 18 files: components, lib, 6 systems, gpu, ui, 8 tests
  - fix Bevy B0001 query conflict: `Without<AssignedFarm>` on arrival_system returning query for disjointness
  - cargo check: 0 errors, 0 warnings; cargo run --release: launches clean

- **fix terrain z-ordering: AlphaMode2d::Opaque → Blend**
  - terrain was rendering over NPCs because Opaque2d phase executes after Transparent2d regardless of z-value
  - both tilemap layers now use AlphaMode2d::Blend in Transparent2d phase (terrain z=-1.0, buildings z=-0.5, NPCs sort_key=0.0)

- **NPC debug inspector with clipboard copy**
  - add full debug section to game HUD: position, target, home, faction, all state components, recent log entries
  - add "Copy Debug Info" button using `arboard::Clipboard` directly (bevy_egui `EguiClipboard`/`ctx.copy_text()` didn't work)
  - add `NpcStateQuery` SystemParam bundle for querying 15 state marker components
  - guard `click_to_select_system` with `ctx.wants_pointer_input() || ctx.is_pointer_over_area()` — prevents game click handler from stealing egui button clicks (was deselecting NPC on same frame as Copy button press)
  - add `arboard = "3"` dependency

## 2026-02-09
- **main game mode: menu → world gen → play → HUD → cleanup cycle**
  - add `AppState` to `lib.rs` with 4 states: MainMenu (default), Playing, TestMenu, Running
  - game systems gated on `Playing | Running` via `.or()` run condition (shared between real game and debug tests)
  - add `ui/main_menu.rs`: egui main menu with world config sliders (size, towns, farmers, guards, raiders) + Play / Debug Tests buttons
  - add `ui/game_hud.rs`: egui side panel HUD with game time, population stats, food, kill stats, NPC inspector (HP/energy bars, job, trait, town)
  - add `ui/mod.rs`: game startup (OnEnter Playing) generates world + spawns NPCs per town, game cleanup (OnExit Playing) despawns all entities + resets resources, ESC/Space/+/- controls
  - add `TilemapSpawned` Resource (replaces `Local<bool>`) so cleanup can reset it for re-entry
  - change tilemap z-ordering: terrain -1.0→-100.0, buildings -0.5→-99.0 (NPCs were rendering under terrain)
  - add "Back to Menu" button in test menu alongside "Run All"
  - `CleanupWorld` + `CleanupDebug` SystemParam bundles keep cleanup system under 16-param limit
  - known issue: NPCs still render under terrain despite z-ordering change (needs further investigation)

- **sync_visual_sprites: derive visual state from ECS, remove redundant GPU messages**
  - add `sync_visual_sprites` system (gpu.rs): derives colors, equipment, indicators from ECS components each frame
  - remove 4 GpuUpdate variants: SetColor, SetHealing, SetSleeping, SetEquipSprite — visual state no longer deferred via messages
  - remove SetColor/SetEquipSprite sends from spawn_npc_system, decision_system, arrival_system, death_cleanup_system
  - remove SetHealing sends from healing_system — visual derived from Healing marker component
  - remove SetSleeping sends from decision_system — visual derived from Resting marker component
  - consolidate RAIDER_COLORS palette + `raider_faction_color()` to constants.rs (was duplicated in spawn.rs + behavior.rs)
  - healing_system: remove Healing marker when NPC fully healed (was only removed when leaving zone)
  - all 15 tests pass at time_scale=1 (no accelerated time), build clean with 0 warnings

- **fix 6 timed-out tests at time_scale=1**
  - energy: spawn with home=(-1,-1) so rest_score=0; start energy=55; completes in 6s
  - guard-patrol: start energy=40; P5 timeout 40s for recovery walk time; completes in 33s
  - farmer-cycle: start energy=35; P5 checks resting==0 not going_work; completes in 25s
  - sleep-visual: start energy=35; schedule tick after sync_visual_sprites; completes in 25s
  - economy: farm progress 0.5→0.95; completes in 30s
  - farm-visual: farm progress 0.8→0.95; completes in 1.5s
  - key pattern: set initial energy via mutable query + flag on first tick (avoids racing spawn frame)

- **suppress debug tick spam across test runs**
  - remove explicit `flags.combat=true` / `flags.readback=true` from vertical_slice, combat, projectiles test setups
  - add DebugFlags reset to `cleanup_test_world` (CleanupExtra bundle) — prevents flag bleed between tests

- **stage 6 green phase: visual indicator render layers + test refactor**
  - add 2 new render layers: Status (layer 5, sleep icon) and Healing (layer 6, heal glow)
  - LAYER_COUNT 5→7, EquipLayer enum extended with Status=4 and Healing=5
  - wire SetHealing to write HEAL_SPRITE to `healing_sprites` buffer (was no-op)
  - add SetSleeping message, sent from behavior.rs at 3 Resting insert/remove sites
  - add `farm_visual_system`: spawns/despawns FarmReadyMarker on farm state transitions
  - update sleep/heal visual tests to check dedicated buffers (`status_sprites`/`healing_sprites`)
  - refactor test infrastructure: TestSetupParams SystemParam bundle, tick_elapsed/require_entity/keep_fed helpers (-278 lines)
  - heal-visual phases 1-2 pass; sleep-visual and farm-visual still have timing issues to debug

- **fix healing test: all 3 phases pass**
  - keep farmer fed each tick (`LastAteHour = total_hours`) — isolates healing from starvation
  - healing was 2/3 (hp regressed due to starvation HP cap), now ALL PASS
  - all 12 behavior tests pass; 3 visual indicator red tests remain (expected)

- **review fixes for visual indicator tests**
  - `sleep_visual.rs`: add missing FarmStates init, fix `starting_post: 0` → `-1`
  - `mod.rs`: add FarmReadyMarker cleanup to `cleanup_test_world`

- **fix guard-patrol test: all 5 phases pass**
  - tired guards now leave post (Priority 6 energy check) and fall through to rest scoring
  - test keeps guard fed via `LastAteHour` reset each tick — isolates duty cycle from starvation
  - guard-patrol was 3/5, now ALL PASS

- **gate tick spam behind debug flag**
  - "Tick: N NPCs active" log now requires `flags.readback` (F1) to be on
  - merge the NPC count log into the readback block — no output unless F1 toggled

- **visual indicator test infrastructure (red tests)**
  - add `sleep_visual.rs`: resting NPC gets SLEEP_SPRITE on item layer, cleared on wake (3 phases)
  - add `farm_visual.rs`: ready farm spawns FarmReadyMarker entity, removed on harvest (3 phases)
  - add `heal_visual.rs`: healing NPC gets HEAL_SPRITE on item layer, cleared when healed (3 phases)
  - add `FarmReadyMarker` component, `SLEEP_SPRITE` and `HEAL_SPRITE` constants
  - tests are expected to fail Phase 2 until visual systems write to `item_sprites`/spawn markers

- **require(HasTarget) on transit components: compile-time arrival detection guarantee**
  - add `#[require(HasTarget)]` to 6 transit components (Patrolling, GoingToRest, GoingToWork, Raiding, Returning, Wandering)
  - add `Default` derive to `HasTarget` (required by `#[require]`)
  - remove 13 manual `.insert(HasTarget)` calls from `decision_system` and 1 from `spawn_npc_system`
  - Bevy's required components auto-insert `HasTarget` on any `.insert(Patrolling)` etc — impossible to forget

- **camera: eliminate CameraState duplication, Bevy camera is single source of truth**
  - remove `CameraState` from main world (`init_resource`, `ExtractResourcePlugin`)
  - remove `camera_viewport_sync` and `camera_transform_sync` systems (6 systems → 4)
  - `camera_pan_system` and `camera_zoom_system` write directly to `Transform` + `Projection`
  - `click_to_select_system` reads `Transform` + `Projection` instead of `CameraState`
  - add `extract_camera_state` in render world ExtractSchedule: reads Camera2d entity → builds CameraState for shader
  - add `ortho_zoom()` helper: reads zoom from `Projection::Orthographic.scale`

- **building tilemap: two-layer TilemapChunk (terrain + buildings)**
  - buildings now rendered via second TilemapChunk layer (z=-0.5, AlphaMode2d::Blend) on top of terrain (z=-1, Opaque)
  - generic `build_tileset(atlas, tiles, images)` replaces `build_terrain_tileset()` — same pixel-copy logic, parameterized by tile list
  - add `BUILDING_TILES` const (5 atlas positions: fountain, bed, guard post, farm, camp)
  - add `Building::tileset_index()` mapping building variant to tileset array index
  - add `spawn_chunk()` DRY helper in render.rs, called twice for terrain and building layers
  - rename `spawn_terrain_tilemap` → `spawn_world_tilemap`
  - remove `WorldRenderInstances` resource, `compute_world_render_instances` system, `ExtractResourcePlugin` from instanced renderer
  - `LAYER_COUNT` 6→5: body(0), armor(1), helmet(2), weapon(3), item(4) — buildings no longer instanced
  - remove dead code from world.rs: `SpriteDef`, `LocationType`, `SpriteInstance`, `get_all_sprites()`, sprite constants

- **terrain tilemap: migrate 62K instanced terrain to TilemapChunk**
  - terrain rendered via Bevy's built-in `TilemapChunk` (single quad, fragment shader tile lookup, zero per-frame CPU cost)
  - `build_terrain_tileset()`: extracts 11 terrain tiles from world atlas into `texture_2d_array` at runtime
  - `Biome::tileset_index()`: maps biome + cell position to tileset array index (0-10)
  - `spawn_terrain_tilemap` system: spawns TilemapChunk entity when WorldGrid populated + atlas loaded
  - remove terrain from instanced pipeline: `LAYER_COUNT` 7→6, `WorldRenderInstances` buildings-only
  - remove dead `Biome::sprite()` method (replaced by tileset_index)
  - add FPS counter overlay (egui, bottom-left, EMA-smoothed)
  - suppress tick log when 0 NPCs active

- **unified instanced renderer: terrain + buildings + NPCs in one pipeline**
  - rename `NpcInstanceData` → `InstanceData`, add `scale` (per-instance quad size) and `atlas_id` (atlas selection) fields (40→48 bytes)
  - bind both character and world atlases simultaneously (group 0, bindings 0-3)
  - shader selects atlas per-instance: character (NPCs/equipment/projectiles) or world (terrain/buildings)
  - add `WorldRenderInstances` resource: pre-computed terrain + building instances, extracted to render world
  - add `compute_world_render_instances` system: builds 62,500 terrain + ~42 building instances from WorldGrid
  - add `Biome::sprite(cell_index)` method for deterministic terrain sprite variation
  - `LAYER_COUNT` 5→7: terrain (0), buildings (1), NPC body (2), equipment (3-6)
  - world-gen test now renders visible terrain tiles and buildings
  - tests stay running after pass/fail (single test mode) — user clicks Back to return

- **fix arrival detection: consolidate to single targeting path**
  - remove dead `SetTargetMsg` + `apply_targets_system` (redundant O(n) entity scan, nobody wrote SetTargetMsg)
  - remove dead `ArrivalMsg` + `ARRIVAL_QUEUE` + `drain_arrival_queue` (nothing ever wrote to the queue)
  - remove ArrivalMsg event-reading section from `arrival_system` (now proximity checks only)
  - add `HasTarget` insert at all 13 transit points in `decision_system` (was missing — arrival detection required it)
  - single targeting path: `decision_system` writes `GpuUpdate::SetTarget` + inserts `HasTarget` → `gpu_position_readback` detects arrival → `AtDestination`
  - fixes guard-patrol Phase 3, farmer-cycle Phase 5, raider-cycle Phase 2, combat Phase 5, projectiles Phase 3
  - 4 previously-failing tests now fully pass (farmer-cycle, raider-cycle, combat, projectiles)


- **world grid + procedural generation (TDD)**
  - add `WorldGrid` resource: 250x250 cell grid (32px/cell) covering 8000x8000 world
  - add `WorldCell` with `Biome` (Grass/Forest/Water/Rock/Dirt) + `Option<Building>` layers
  - add `Building` enum: Fountain, Farm, Bed, GuardPost, Camp (each with town_idx)
  - add `WorldGenConfig` resource with defaults (2 towns, 1200px spacing, 1100px camp distance)
  - add `generate_world()` pure function: random town placement, camp positioning, simplex terrain, building layout
  - add terrain generation via `noise` crate (simplex noise, Dirt override near settlements)
  - add `world_gen.rs` test (6 phases): grid dimensions, town count, distances, buildings, terrain, camps
  - add `rand` 0.9 and `noise` 0.9 dependencies
  - all 6 test phases pass

- **stage 5: write 10 test suites**
  - add `spawning.rs`: spawn 5 NPCs, kill one, verify slot freed and reused (4 phases)
  - add `energy.rs`: energy starts at 100, drains, reaches ENERGY_HUNGRY (3 phases, time_scale=50)
  - add `movement.rs`: HasTarget set, GPU positions update, AtDestination on arrival (3 phases)
  - add `guard_patrol.rs`: OnDuty → Patrolling → OnDuty → rest → resume (5 phases, time_scale=20)
  - add `farmer_cycle.rs`: GoingToWork → Working → tired → rest → return (5 phases, time_scale=20)
  - add `raider_cycle.rs`: dispatch group → steal food → return → deliver (5 phases, time_scale=20)
  - add `combat.rs`: GPU targeting → InCombat → damage → death → slot freed (6 phases)
  - add `projectiles.rs`: ranged targeting → projectile spawn → hit → slot freed (4 phases)
  - add `healing.rs`: damaged NPC near town → Healing marker → health recovers (3 phases, time_scale=20)
  - add `economy.rs`: farm growth → harvest → camp forage → raider respawn (5 phases, time_scale=50)
  - add `Debug` derive to `FarmGrowthState` (needed for test display)

- **test framework (stage 5)**
  - add UI-selectable test menu via bevy_egui (`EguiPrimaryContextPass` schedule)
  - add `AppState` (TestMenu | Running) — all game systems gated on `in_state(Running)`
  - add `TestState`, `TestRegistry`, `RunAllState` resources for test lifecycle
  - add `test_is("name")` run condition for per-test system gating
  - add test HUD: phase checklist overlay with `○` pending, `▶` active, `✓` passed, `✗` failed
  - add Run All: sequential test execution with summary on completion
  - add `CleanupCore`/`CleanupExtra` SystemParam bundles (avoids 16-param limit)
  - add `cleanup_test_world` (OnExit Running): despawn NPC entities, reset all resources
  - relocate Test12 to `tests/vertical_slice.rs` (8 phases, all passing in ~4s)
  - remove `Test12` resource from `resources.rs`

- **multi-layer equipment rendering**
  - add EquipLayer enum (Armor, Helmet, Weapon, Item) + EquippedWeapon/Helmet/Armor components (components.rs)
  - add EQUIP_SWORD, EQUIP_HELMET, FOOD_SPRITE sprite constants (constants.rs)
  - add SetEquipSprite GpuUpdate variant, remove SetCarriedItem (messages.rs)
  - add 4 equipment sprite Vec fields to NpcBufferWrites (stride 2, -1.0 sentinel), route by EquipLayer in apply() (gpu.rs)
  - refactor NpcRenderBuffers: single instance_buffer → Vec<LayerBuffer> with 5 layers (npc_render.rs)
  - DrawNpcs draws all non-empty layers sequentially (body → armor → helmet → weapon → item)
  - npc_render.wgsl: equipment layers (health >= 0.99) discard bottom pixels to preserve health bar
  - spawn clears all equipment, then sets job-specific gear: guards get sword+helmet, raiders get sword
  - death_cleanup clears all 4 equipment layers on death (prevents stale slot data)
  - behavior.rs: SetCarriedItem → SetEquipSprite(Item) for food carry/deliver
  - test 12 passes

- **damage flash (white overlay on hit, fade out)**
  - add `SetDamageFlash { idx, intensity }` to GpuUpdate enum (messages.rs)
  - add `flash_values: Vec<f32>` to NpcBufferWrites, handle in apply(), decay at 5.0/s in populate_buffer_writes (gpu.rs)
  - damage_system sends SetDamageFlash(1.0) after SetHealth (health.rs)
  - add `flash: f32` to NpcInstanceData (36 → 40 bytes), vertex attribute @location(6) (npc_render.rs)
  - npc_render.wgsl: add flash to vertex I/O, mix(color, white, flash) in fragment shader
  - test 12 passes

- **health bars + projectile sprite**
  - add `health: f32` to NpcInstanceData (32 → 36 bytes), vertex attribute @location(5)
  - prepare_npc_buffers reads NpcBufferWrites.healths, normalizes by /100.0
  - prepare_proj_buffers sets health=1.0 (no bar on projectiles)
  - npc_render.wgsl: pass quad_uv + health through vertex shader, 3-color health bar in bottom 15% of sprite (green >50%, yellow >25%, red ≤25%), show-when-damaged mode
  - change projectile sprite from (7, 0) to (20, 7)
  - test 12 passes (2.3s)

## 2026-02-08
- **projectile instanced rendering**
  - add projectile position readback: COPY_SRC on proj_positions buffer, position_staging buffer, copy in ProjectileComputeNode, PROJ_POSITION_STATE static
  - merge readback_proj_hits into readback_proj_data: single device.poll() reads both hits and positions
  - add ProjBatch marker, ProjRenderBuffers resource, DrawProjs RenderCommand, DrawProjCommands type
  - add spawn_proj_batch, extract_proj_batch, prepare_proj_buffers, queue_projs systems in NpcRenderPlugin
  - projectiles reuse NPC pipeline, shader, quad geometry, texture and camera bind groups
  - faction-colored: blue (0.4, 0.6, 1.0) for villagers, red (1.0, 0.3, 0.2) for raiders
  - sort_key=1.0 renders projectiles above NPCs (0.0)
  - test 12 passes (2.3s)

- **camera controls: WASD pan + scroll zoom + click-to-select**
  - npc_render.wgsl: replace hardcoded CAMERA_POS/VIEWPORT with `Camera` uniform struct at @group(1) @binding(0)

  - pipeline layout: 2 bind groups (texture at 0, camera at 1)
  - pan speed 400px/s scaled by 1/zoom, scroll zoom factor 0.1 toward mouse cursor (range 0.1–4.0)
  - click-to-select: screen-to-world via CameraState, nearest NPC within 20px from GPU_READ_STATE
  - delete old .glsl shaders and .zip archive (cleanup)
  - test 12 passes (2.3s)

- **port separation physics from glsl to wgsl compute shader**
  - boids-style separation force: 3x3 grid neighbor scan, asymmetric push (moving=0.2x, settled=2.0x), golden angle for exact overlap
  - TCP-style dodge: perpendicular avoidance for converging NPCs (head-on/crossing/overtaking), consistent side-picking via index comparison
  - backoff persistence: blocked NPCs slow down exponentially (persistence = 1/(1+backoff)), blocking detection via push/goal alignment
  - backoff buffer (binding 6) now read/written by shader — was allocated but unused
  - all params now active: separation_radius, separation_strength, grid_width/height, cell_size, max_per_cell
  - combat targeting unchanged (wider search radius than GLSL version)
  - test 12 still passes (5.3s, down from 6.8s)

## 2026-02-08
- **test 12: vertical slice integration test — phase 4 complete**
  - add Test12 resource with phased assertions (8 phases, time-gated, PASS/FAIL logging)

  - test12_tick: validates spawn → GPU readback → farmers working → raiders raiding → combat → death → respawn
  - all 8 phases pass in 6.8s at time_scale=10
  - fix: add CPU-side arrival detection in gpu_position_readback (position vs goal within ARRIVAL_THRESHOLD → AtDestination)
  - fix: add HasTarget component to farmers at spawn (was missing, blocking arrival detection)
  - ARRIVAL_QUEUE static is now unused — replaced by CPU-side arrival detection in movement.rs

- **docs: authority model and roadmap restructure**
  - messages.md: Data Ownership → Data Ownership & Authority Model with 4 categories (GPU-authoritative, CPU-authoritative, CPU-only, render-only)
  - added staleness budget (1 frame, 1.6px drift) and anti-pattern rule (no read-then-write feedback loops)
  - fixed stale entries: GPU_READ_STATE now documented as populated, removed "not yet ported" references
  - roadmap: restructured phases 4-7 from infrastructure milestones to gameplay-driven milestones (core loop → visual feedback → playable game → content)
  - roadmap: added multi-layer equipment rendering spec with data model, implementation steps, and performance budget
  - roadmap: added maintenance guide (phases = priority, capabilities = backlog)
  - behavior.md: removed strikethrough fixed-bug (changelog material)
  - gpu-compute.md: "not ported from old GLSL shader" → "not yet implemented"
  - economy.md, rendering.md: created from behavior.md split + new render pipeline docs

  - attack_system: reads GPU combat_targets, fires projectiles via PROJ_GPU_UPDATE_QUEUE or applies point-blank damage
  - projectile hit readback: hit_staging buffer, readback_proj_hits system, PROJ_HIT_STATE static
  - process_proj_hits: converts hits to DamageMsg, recycles projectile slots
  - arrival flag reset: SetTarget resets arrivals[idx]=0 so GPU resumes movement toward chase targets
  - ProjBufferWrites default dirty=true for first-frame -1 hit initialization
  - Deactivate also resets hits buffer to -1 to prevent re-triggers
  - test_spawn_combat: 5v5 faction fighters for combat pipeline verification
  - debug_tick_system: F2 combat logging shows targets/attacks/chases/deaths per second
  - verified: NPCs find targets (9/10), chase out-of-range enemies, point-blank damage reduces NPC count

- **gpu→ecs position readback + debug flags**
  - add staging buffer (MAP_READ | COPY_DST) to NpcGpuBuffers for position readback
  - copy positions to staging after compute dispatch in NpcComputeNode
  - add readback_npc_positions system (Cleanup phase): map staging, write to GPU_READ_STATE
  - register existing sync_gpu_state_to_bevy (Step::Drain) and gpu_position_readback (after Drain)

  - add projectile compute pipeline to gpu.rs: ProjGpuBuffers (8 buffers), ProjComputeParams, ProjBufferWrites, ProjectileComputeNode
  - render graph: NpcCompute → ProjectileCompute → CameraDriver (grid built before projectile reads it)
  - projectile bind group shares NPC buffers (positions, factions, healths, grid) as read-only
  - pipeline compiles and dispatches; no-op with proj_count=0

- **restructure: flatten project layout**
  - flatten gpu/mod.rs → gpu.rs, render/mod.rs → render.rs (single-file modules don't need folders)
  - move shaders from assets/shaders/ to root shaders/ (all shaders in one place)
  - delete Godot .import files from assets/
